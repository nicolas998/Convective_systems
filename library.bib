@article{Kubota1995,
abstract = {Methodologies for developing a macro-scale model of subsurface stormflow generation on a steep forested catchment in Japan are addressed. Field studies on this catchment have indicated that subsurface flow, consisting mainly of 'old' water displaced by 'new' rain water, dominates the storm response. Detailed field measurements on the catchment allowed simple, catchment-scale relationships to be developed between the volume of saturated groundwater, on the one hand, and discharge, and surface and subsurface saturated areas, on the other. Attempts are made to find linkages between these empirical relationships and physically-based descriptions of hydrological processes operating at smaller scales. A distributed model based on the saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow on steep catchments was developed and tested with field data collected on this catchment. Derivation of catchment-scale relationships can be carried out by a straightforward integration of the distributed model output. An alternative disaggregation-aggregation approach is presented, whereby the catchment is divided into a number of hillslope flow strips. By applying the distributed model on each flow strip, under steady-state conditions, it is possible to infer the spatial variability of groundwater volume in the various flow strips. This variability is related to a measure of hillslope topography and geometry. Knowing the catch-ment topography and geometry for any catchment, it is then possible to derive useful catchment-scale relationships which are applicable under quasi-steady-state conditions, Hydrological relationships derived in this manner are compared with corresponding empirical relationships. The methodologies presented are effective for understanding the linkages between catchment scale response and small-scale flow processes.},

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The values of these parameters are obtained using the Philip approach, which employs the hydraulic properties of soil. In the absence of extensive measurements, the tabulated results can be used in modelling infiltration. The paper introduces approximate sorptivity expressions that use a limited number of parameters. Sorptivity may be estimated reasonably well from a knowledge of moisture deficit, a representative capillary pressure, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The accuracy of prediction is highest for coarser materials. For coarse materials (sands), second-power sorptivity can be approximated as a linear function of initial effective saturation. The proposed expressions for sorptivity can be used as a substitute for the lengthy Philip procedure. ?? 1986.},

@article{Li2013,
abstract = {Baseflow is often regarded as the streamflow component derived predominantly from groundwater discharge. The estimation of baseflow is important for water supply, water allocation, investigation of contamination impacts, low flow hydrology and flood hydrology. Baseflow is commonly estimated using graphical methods, recursive digital filters (RDFs), tracer based methods, and conceptual models. Of all of these methods, RDFs are the most commonly used, due to their relatively easy and efficient implementation. This paper presents a generic framework for assessing and improving the performance of RDFs for baseflow estimation for catchments with different characteristics and subject to different hydrological conditions. As part of the framework, a fully integrated surface water/groundwater (SW/GW) model is used to obtain estimates of streamflow and baseflow for catchments with different properties, such as soil types and rainfall patterns. An RDF is then applied to the simulated streamflow to assess how well the baseflow obtained using the filter matches the baseflow obtained using the fully integrated SW/GW model. In order to improve the performance of the filter, the user-defined parameter(s) controlling filter operation can be adjusted in order to obtain the best match between the baseflow obtained using the filter and that obtained using the fully integrated SW/GW model (i.e. through calibration). The proposed framework is tested by applying it to a common SW/GW benchmarking problem, the tilted V-catchment, for a range of soil properties. HydroGeoSphere (HGS) is used to develop the fully integrated SW/GW model and the Lyne and Hollick (LH) filter is used as the RDF. The performance of the LH filter is assessed using the commonly used value of the filter parameter of 0.925, as well as calibrated filter parameter values. The results obtained show that the performance of the LH filter is affected significantly by the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of the soil and that calibrated LH filter parameter can result in significant improvements in filter performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have shown the significance of representing groundwater in land surface hydrologic simulations. However, optimal methods for model parameter calibration in order to realistically simulate baseflow and groundwater depth have received little attention. Most studies still use globally constant groundwater parameters due to the lack of available datasets for calibration. Moreover, when models are calibrated, various parameter combinations are found to exhibit equifinality in simulated total runoff due to model parameter interactions. In this study, a simple lumped groundwater model is incorporated into the Community Land Model (CLM), in which the water table is interactively coupled to soil moisture through the groundwater recharge fluxes. The coupled model (CLMGW) is successfully validated in Illinois using a 22-year (1984-2005) monthly observational dataset. Baseflow estimates from the digital recursive filter technique are used to calibrate the CLMGW parameters. The advantage obtained from incorporating baseflow calibration in addition to traditional calibration based on measured streamflow alone is demonstrated by a Monte Carlo-type simulation analysis. Using the optimal parameter sets identified from baseflow calibration, flow partitioning and water table depth simulations using CLMGW are improved, and the equifinality problem is alleviated. For other regions that lack observations of water table depth, the baseflow calibration approach can be used to enhance parameter estimation and constrain water table depth simulations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Mass movements are the product of a progressive reduction of strength of slope geomaterials by human actions or natural processes, such as weathering, and triggered by external factors like rainfall or earthquakes. These events have demonstrated throughout history its destructive capacity, causing huge human and economic losses, especially in tropical and mountainous terrains, such as the Aburr{\'{a}} Valley. For this reason new studies on rainfall forecasting, real-time monitoring and the definition of critical rainfall thresholds have become essential tools for the implementation of early warning systems. This analysis of critical rainfall thresholds for landslides forecasting in the Aburr{\'{a}} Valley was performed by an empirical procedure, using a database of mass movements and a database of precipitation with 15-min temporal resolution. Accumulated rainfall for every mass movement was estimated for short-term --LA-- (1, 3, 5 and 7 days) and long-term --LAA-- (5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days). The results show that the major determinant for the occurrence of mass movements in the Aburr{\'{a}} Valley is the LAA. The data indicate that mass movements used in the analysis occurred for LAA over 60 mm for 30 days, 160 mm for 60 days and 200 mm for 90 days. However, it is necessary to evaluate in detail this type of analysis and thresholds, widely performed in the world, clearly influenced, due to they generally do not consider those rainy days when there were no mass movements. Therefore further studies should be carried out based on analysis of rainfall series and exceedance probabilities. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Baseflow separation methods are often impractical, require expensive materials and time-consuming methods, and/or are not designed for individual events in small watersheds. To provide a simple baseflow separation method for small watersheds, we describe a new precipitation-based technique known as the Sliding Average with Rain Record (SARR). The SARR uses rainfall data to justify each separation of the hydrograph. SARR has several advantages such as: it shows better consistency with the precipitation and discharge records, it is easier and more practical to implement, and it includes a method of event identification based on precipitation and quickflow response. SARR was derived from the United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH) method with several key modifications to adapt it for small watersheds ({\textless}50km 2). We tested SARR on watersheds in the Choptank Basin on the Delmarva Peninsula (US Mid-Atlantic region) and compared the results with the UKIH method at the annual scale and the hydrochemical method at the individual event scale. Annually, SARR calculated a baseflow index that was ???10{\%} higher than the UKIH method due to the finer time step of SARR (1 d) compared to UKIH (5 d). At the watershed scale, hydric soils were an important driver of the annual baseflow index likely due to increased groundwater retention in hydric areas. At the event scale, SARR calculated less baseflow than the hydrochemical method, again because of the differences in time step (hourly for hydrochemical) and different definitions of baseflow. Both SARR and hydrochemical baseflow increased with event size, suggesting that baseflow contributions are more important during larger storms. To make SARR easy to implement, we have written a MatLab program to automate the calculations which requires only daily rainfall and daily flow data as inputs. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Since the 1950s there has been continuing interest in the problem of joining the intermediate-time series solution for one-dimensional infiltration and the large time traveling wave solution. In practical field terms, however, observational errors, and errors produced by minor heterogeneities and nonuniformities of initial moisture content, will be far larger than the errors of even the crudest joining technique. The practical problem thus warrants only the minimum number of parameters and maximum simplicity. For soils which are initially relatively dry, two parameters suffice, and these are ideally taken as the physically meaningful and measurable sorptivity S and hydraulic conductivity K1. Polynomial fractions are unsuitable; piecewise representation is simple and adequate for most purposes, but a technique using the Knight infiltration solution of Burgers' equation gives greater accuracy. It is well suited when a continuous representation and/or accuracy is desired.},

abstract = {Soil characteristics have a fundamental influence on the motion of vehicles traversing terrain. The principal mechanical parameters of soils are moisture content, load- bearing capacity, shear strength and soil settlement, which in turn influences soil density. These characteristics take effect on the vehicle's motion through the shear and normal loads which develop between the soil and the tyre. Moisture content assists the travel of the vehicle in some soils assists and hinders it in others. The level of settlement of the soil crucially influences its load-bearing capacity. Newly-tilled soil has a poor load-bearing capacity, and is therefore prone to large vertical deformations. Measurements were performed on a particular loam soil to determine the changes of internal friction with moisture content; cohesion with settlement and cone index; and cone index with settlement. The tests were performed on soil which had settled after various tillage operations--. The measurements were made in February, March, April, June, October and December, and thus spanned a whole year. To systemize the measurement series and render them repeatable, twelve test points were marked out on the test area. These points were fixed using a GPS device to ensure successive measurements were made at precisely the same places. Evaluation of the test results show that the internal friction of the soil decreased with increasing moisture content. This agrees with other findings in the literature, and is due to the lubricating effect of the water. Cohesion and cone index increased with settlement, a dependence which indicates that it is insufficient to measure the variation of cohesion and cone index as a function of moisture content alone. Since the effects of moisture content, settlement, cohesion and cone index on the soil-tyre interaction have not yet been sufficiently established, such measurements are an important contribution to a deeper understanding of the mechanical parameters of soils.},

abstract = {The complexity of available hydrological models continues to increase, with fully integrated surface water-groundwater flow and transport models now available. Nevertheless, an accurate quantification of streamflow generation mechanisms within these models is not yet possible. For example, such models do not report the groundwater component of streamflow at a particular point along the stream. Instead, the groundwater component of streamflow is approximated either from tracer transport simulations or by the sum of exchange fluxes between the surface and the subsurface along the river. In this study, a hydraulic mixing-cell (HMC) method is developed and tested that allows to accurately determine the groundwater component of streamflow by using only the flow solution from fully integrated surface water-groundwater flow models. By using the HMC method, the groundwater component of streamflow can be extracted accurately at any point along a stream provided the subsurface/surface exchanges along the stream are calculated by the model. A key advantage of the HMC method is that only hydraulic information is used, thus the simulation of tracer transport is not required. Two numerical experiments are presented, the first to test the HMC method and the second to demonstrate that it quantifies the groundwater component of streamflow accurately. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Baseflow is often considered to be the groundwater discharge component of streamflow. It is commonly estimated using conceptual models, recursive filters or a combination of the two. However, it is difficult to validate these methods due to the current challenges of measuring baseflow in the field. In this study, simulation of a synthetic catchment's response to rainfall is carried out using a fully integrated surface water-groundwater flow model. A series of rainfall events with differing recovery periods and varied antecedent moisture conditions is considered to span a range of different streamflow generation dynamics. Baseflow is estimated for the outlet hydrograph of the synthetic catchment using a selection of commonly used automated baseflow separation methods. These estimates are compared to the baseflow signal obtained from the numerical model, which serves as the control experiment. Results from these comparisons show that depending on the method used, automated baseflow separation underestimates the simulated baseflow by as much as 28{\%}, or overestimates it by up to 74{\%}, during rainfall events. No separation method is found to be clearly superior to the others, as the performance of the various methods varies with different soil types, antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall events. The differences between the various approaches clearly demonstrate that the baseflow separation methods investigated are not universally applicable. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban streamflow is commonly characterized by increased peak discharges and runoff volumes. Slowflow integrates altered storage and transit times affecting urban recharge and drainage, resulting in a highly variable indeterminate urban slowflow response. This study introduces the use of multiple baseflow metrics to characterize and interpret the dominant processes driving urban slowflow response. Slowflow characteristics derived from USGS streamflow records are used to quantify the patterns of hydrologic alteration across the rural-to-urban landuse gradient in the Piedmont watersheds of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), an NSF Urban Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the Baltimore Metropolitan area. We interpret multimetric slowflow response from a top-down perspective, learning from data, in order to draw dominant process inferences from observed slowflow. When characterized by a single slowflow metric such as the baseflow index, urban slowflow response can exhibit equifinality and is not reliably predicted a priori. Multimetric analysis quantifies distinct differences in urban slowflow response, framing testable hypotheses and refined experimental designs to elucidate the dominant processes driving urban slowflow. Multimetric fingerprinting offers a consistent framework for interpreting urban slowflow response, constrained by the equifinality of single slowflow metrics and the inherent limitations on process inferences that can be drawn from gauged streamflow alone. Heterogeneity of observed slowflow belies the simple paradigm of a single consistent type of urban slowflow response. In contrast, we suggest a conceptual typology of urban slowflow response, framing a conceptual mixing model of dominant process endpoints that shape the slowflow fingerprints of urban hydrology. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Base flow is an important component in hydrological modeling. This process is usually modeled by using the linear aquifer storage-discharge relation approach, although the outflow from groundwater aquifers is nonlinear. To identify the accuracy of base flow estimates in rivers dominated by snowmelt and/or glacier melt in arid and cold northwestern China, a nonlinear storage-discharge relationship for use in SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) modeling was developed and applied to the Manas River basin in the Tian Shan Mountains. Linear reservoir models and a digital filter program were used for comparisons. Meanwhile, numerical analysis of recession curves from 78 river gauge stations revealed variation in the parameters of the nonlinear relationship. It was found that the nonlinear reservoir model can improve the streamflow simulation, especially for low-flow period. The higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, logarithmic efficiency, and volumetric efficiency, and lower percent bias were obtained when compared to the one-linear reservoir approach. The parameter {\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}/i{\textgreater} of the aquifer storage-discharge function varied mostly between 0.0 and 0.1, which is much smaller than the suggested value of 0.5.

One of the last contributions on this subject was given by Ekchardt (2005) who proposed a more general form of a digital baseflow filter and showed that some of the most used filters are special cases of this general form. This new filter has the inconvenience of having two parameters, one of them may be obtained directly from recession analysis, but the other (maximum baseflow index (BFImax)) is routinely estimated by a priori defined values according to the predominant geological characteristics of the drainage basin. In this short communication, we propose a method to estimate BFImax by a backwards filtering operation. The method was applied using data from 15 gauging stations in Brazil, with a varied range of groundwater contribution to streamflow. Results of the new estimation method for the BFImax parameter are coherent with the values which would be adopted by considering geological characteristics of the river basins.},

This holistic (as opposed to reductionist) estimation method is demonstrated for the Harris River catchment in southwest Western Australia. The relationship between the groundwater discharge and the reservoir storage of shallow unconfined aquifers was found to be nonlinear based on the analysis of numerous streamflow recession curves. However, depletion of groundwater by evapotranspiration losses, through the water uptake of tree roots, was found to bias the recession curves and the estimated reservoir parameters. As a result of the seasonality of both rainfall and potential evaporation, analysis of the recession curves, stratified according to time of the year, allowed the quantification of evapotranspiration loss as a function of calendar month and stored groundwater storage. Time series of recharge to the groundwater aquifer were computed from the observed total streamflows, and the estimated discharge and evapotranspiration losses, by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. Using traditional unit hydrograph methods unit recharge responses to rainfall were computed by least squares fitting. The shapes of the estimated unit response functions showed no significant seasonal variation.},

We use here an existing geomorphological interpretation of recession dynamics, which links the exponent in the classic recession curve -dQ / dt = kQ?? to the geometric properties of the time-varying drainage network to study the general properties of recession curves across a wide variety of river basins. In particular, we show how the parameter k depends on the initial soil moisture state of the basin and can be made to explicitly depend on an index discharge, representative of initial sub-subsurface storage. Through this framework we obtain a non-dimensional, event-independent, recession curve. We subsequently quantify the variability of k across different basins on the basis of their geometry, and, by rescaling, collapse curves from different events and basins to obtain a generalized, or 'universal', recession curve. Finally, we analyze the resulting normalized recession curves and explain their universal characteristics, lending further support to the notion that the statistical properties of observed recession curves bear the signature of the geomorphological structure of the networks producing them. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Streamflow recession has been investigated by a variety of methods, often involving the fit of a model to empirical recession plots to parameterize a non-linear storage–outflow relationship based on the dQ/dt−Q method. Such recession analysis methods (RAMs) are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity, storage capacity, or aquifer thickness and to model streamflow recession curves for regionalization and prediction at the catchment scale. Numerous RAMs have been published, but little is known about how comparably the resulting recession models distinguish characteristic catchment behavior. In this study we combined three established recession extraction methods with three different parameter-fitting methods to the power-law storage–outflow model to compare the range of recession characteristics that result from the application of these different RAMs. Resulting recession characteristics including recession time and corresponding storage depletion were evaluated for 20 meso-scale catchments in Germany. We found plausible ranges for model parameterization; however, calculated recession characteristics varied over two orders of magnitude. While recession characteristics of the 20 catchments derived with the different methods correlate strongly, particularly for the RAMs that use the same extraction method, not all rank the catchments consistently, and the differences among some of the methods are larger than among the catchments. To elucidate this variability we discuss the ambiguous roles of recession extraction procedures and the parameterization of the storage–outflow model and the limitations of the presented recession plots. The results suggest strong limitations to the comparability of recession characteristics derived with different methods, not only in the model parameters but also in the relative characterization of different catchments. A multiple-methods approach to investigating streamflow recession characteristics should be considered for applications whenever possible.},

In the past, different formulations of the most simple filter type, the so-called one-parameter filter, have been proposed. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed for filter algorithms that were constructed under the assumption that the outflow from an aquifer is linearly proportional to its storage. It is shown that these one-parameter filters describing an exponential baseflow recession are all special cases of a two-parameter filter whose equation is specified. Its parameters are the recession constant—which can be objectively determined by a recession analysis—and BFImax, the maximum value of the baseflow index that can be modelled by the algorithm. This introduces a subjective element into the baseflow calculation, since BFImax is not measurable. A preliminary analysis based on the results of conventional separation techniques shows that it might be possible to find typical BFImax values for classes of catchments that can be unequivocally distinguished by their hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics.},

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A global database of 2,626 rainfall events that have resulted in shallow landslides and debris flows was compiled through a thorough literature search. The rainfall and landslide information was used to update the dependency of theminimumlevel of rainfall duration and intensity likely to result in shallow landslides and debris flows established by Nel Caine in 1980. The rainfall intensity– duration (ID) values were plotted in logarithmic coordinates, and it was established that with increased rainfall duration, the minimum average intensity likely to trigger shallow slope failures decreases linearly, in the range of durations from 10 min to 35 days. The minimum ID for the possible initiation of shallow landslides and debris flowswas determined.The threshold curvewas obtained from the rainfall data using an objective statistical technique. To cope with differences in the intensity and duration of rainfall likely to result in shallow slope failures in different climatic regions, the rainfall information was normalized to the mean annual precipitation and the rainy-day normal. Climate information was obtained from the global climate dataset compiled by the Climate Research Unit of the East Anglia University. The obtained global ID thresholds are significantly lower than the threshold proposed by Caine (GeogrAnn A62:23–27, 1980), and lower than other global thresholdsproposedin the literature. The new global ID thresholds can be used in a worldwide operational landslide warning system based on global precipitationmeasurements where local and regional thresholds are not available.},

abstract = {Hillslope hydrology studies have shown that bedrock surface topography maybe the most important factor affecting subsurface flow, and that soil thickness and soil properties related to topography are important factors in shallow landslide prediction. In this study, the physically based H-slider (hillslope-scale shallow landslide-induced debris flow risk evaluation) model was used to evaluate the effects of topography and soil parameterisation reflecting soil depth on shallow landslide prediction accuracy. Two digital elevation models (DEMs; i.e. ground surface and bedrock surface) and three soil thicknesses (average soil thickness, soil thickness to weathered rock and soil thickness to bedrock) and physical soil parameters (cohesion and internal friction angle) at a small hillslope site in Jinbu, Kangwon Prefecture, eastern part of the Korean Peninsula, were considered. Each prediction result simulated with the H-slider model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for modelling accuracy. The results of the ROC analysis for shallow landslide prediction using the ground surface DEM (GSTO) and the bedrock surface DEM (BSTO) indicated that the prediction accuracy was higher using the GSTO compared to the BSTO. Moreover, the prediction accuracy based on soil parameterisation reflecting soil thickness was highest in all cases. These results imply that the effect of soil parameters on shallow landslide prediction could be larger than the effects of topography and soil thickness. Therefore, we suggest that using soil properties representing the effect of soil thickness can improve the accuracy of shallow landslide prediction, which should contribute to more accurately predicting shallow landsides.},

abstract = {This article attempts to give a very detailed perspective to the challenge and advances associated to rainfall-triggered landslides, which are characteristic and very common in tropical environments, such as Colombia. Landslides are one of the most common hazards around the world. Economic losses caused by landslides are huge, and are often exaggerated due to urban sprawl. Recent findings in this topic around the world have been applied for determining critical thresholds by physical or statistical models, combined with rainfall forecasting and near real time monitoring as fundamental component of an early warning system. Landslides are caused by several phenomena, including geological, geomorphologic and anthropogenic dynamics; however, one variable - precipitation - has a uniquely strong capability to cause rapid, intense slope failure. A review of several studies of rainfall-triggered landslides is presented some of who have used statistical tools that define critical thresholds based on intensity and duration rainfall. Other authors have focused upon physical based models combining hydrological and geotechnical aspects of rainfall, water pore pressure and slope stability},

abstract = {It is widely recognised that soil slips and debris flows are triggered by short intense storms. Owing its geologic, geomorphologic and climatic settings, the Piedmont Region (NW Italy) is highly prone to the occurrence of this kind of landslides. In the last two centuries, in fact, a total of 105 severe meteoric events which triggered shallow failures occurred and, of these, 18 events took place from 1990 to 2002. A fair number of rainfall thresholds have been proposed in the literature, defined both on empirical or on physical bases. Empirical thresholds are defined collecting rainfall data for landslide meteoric events and for events without landslides, while physical thresholds are based on numerical models that consider the relation between rainfall, pore pressure and slope stability. The main objective of this paper is the identification of the empirical triggering thresholds for the Piedmont Region. Four meteoric events were selected and analysed (November 4-5, 1994; July 7-8, 1996; April 27-30, 2000; October 13-16, 2000) because they supply a wide range of variation for both rainfall parameters (duration, intensity, cumulative rainfalls) and the number of induced landslides. In the intensity-duration plot, the critical limit is described by the equation: I = 19D-0.50 (where I = rainfall intensity expressed in mm/h and D = rainfall duration expressed in hours). Such a limit is traced to envelop 90{\%} of the points on the graph. In the NI-D diagram the triggering thresholds are given by the equations NI = 0.76D-0.33 and NI = 4.62D-0.79 (where NI = normalised intensity with respect to the annual precipitation, MAP, expressed in {\%}, [(mm/h)/PMA] ?? 100). In the article the different meaning of these thresholds is discussed. Finally, the diagram NI-NCR is proposed; the triggering threshold is given by the expression: NI = -0.09ln[NCR] + 0.54 (where NCR is the normalised cumulative critical rainfall, [mm/PMA] ?? 100). The application of the triggering thresholds as a fundamental element in a warning system dedicated to the safeguarding of population in landslide-prone areas is discussed. In detail an operating procedure which is presently being verified and tested in the studied area is described. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The model, Triangulated Irregular Networks Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator and VEGetation Generator for Interactive Evolution (tRIBS-VEGGIE), is capable of a sophisticated description of many hydrological processes; in particular, the soil moisture dynamics is resolved at a temporal and spatial resolution required to examine the triggering mechanisms of rainfall-induced landslides. The validity of the tRIBS-VEGGIE model to a tropical environment is shown with an evaluation of its performance against direct observations made within the Luquillo Forest (the study area). The newly developed landslide module builds upon the previous version of the tRIBS landslide component. This new module utilizes a numerical solution to the Richards equation to better represent the time evolution of soil moisture transport through the soil column. Moreover, the new landslide module utilizes an extended formulation of the Factor of Safety (FS) to correctly quantify the role of matric suction in slope stability and to account for unsaturated conditions in the evaluation of FS. The new modeling framework couples the capabilities of the detailed hydrologic model to describe soil moisture dynamics with the Infinite Slope model creating a powerful tool for the assessment of landslide risk.},

These models were tested in Pohang and Gyeongju Cities (South Korea) by using the geographic information system GIS platform. In the first step, a landslide inventory map consisting of 296 landslide locations were prepared from various data sources. Then, a total of 15 landslide causative factors (slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, surface roughness, altitude, distance from drainages, stream power index, topographic wetness index, wood age, wood diameter, wood type, forest density, soil thickness, soil texture, and soil drainage) were extracted from the database and then converted into a raster. Final susceptibility maps exhibit close results from the two models. Models 1 and 3 predicted 82.3{\%} and 80{\%} of testing data during the analysis, respectively. Thus, Models 1 and 3 show better performance than LR. These resultant maps can be used to extend the capability of bivariate statistical based model, by finding the relationship between each single conditioning factor and landslide locations, moreover, the proposed ensemble model can be used to show the inter-relationships importance between each conditioning factors, without the need to refer to the multivariate statistic. The research outcome may provide powerful tools for natural hazard assessment and land use planning. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Catchment modeling in areas dominated by active geomorphologic processes, such as soil erosion and landsliding, is often hampered by the lack of reliable methods for the spatial estimation of soil depth. In a catchment, soil thickness h can vary as a function of many different and interplaying factors, such as underlying lithology, climate, gradient, hillslope curvature, upslope contributing area, and vegetation cover, making the distributed estimation of h challenging and often unreliable. In this work we present an alternative methodology which links soil thickness to gradient, horizontal and vertical slope curvature, and relative position within the hillslope profile. While the relationship with gradient and curvature should reflect the kinematic stability of the regolith cover, allowing greater soil thicknesses over planar and concave areas, the distance from the hill crest (or from the valley bottom) accounts for the position within the soil toposequence. This last parameter is fundamental; points having equal gradient and curvature can have significantly different soil thickness due to their dissimilar position along the hillslope profile. The proposed model has been implemented in a geographic information system environment and tested in the Terzona Creek basin in central Italy. Results are in good agreement with field data (mean absolute error is 11 cm with 8.5 cm standard deviation) and average errors are lower than those obtained with other topography-based methods, where mean absolute error ranges from 47 cm for a model based on curvature, position, and slope gradient to 94 cm for a model based solely on slope gradient. As a further test, the predicted soil thickness was used to determine derived quantities, such as the factor of safety for landsliding potential. Our model, when compared to other empirical methods, returns the best results and, therefore, can improve the prediction of soil losses and sediment production when utilized in conjunction with hydrological and landsliding models.},

In response to the recurring hazard, an alarm and monitoring system was installed to provide a sufficient level of safeguard for inhabitants and infrastructures. The data recorded at three rain gauges during debris-flow events has been analysed, taking into consideration the different elevation of the gauges to delineate the storm rainfall distributions. Rainfall data is compared with the occurrence of debris-flows to examine relations between debris-flow initiation and rainfall. In addition, the data is compared with that recorded during debris-flows which occurred under similar or different geological settings in the Eastern Italian Alps, in order to define triggering thresholds. A threshold for debris-flow activity in terms of mean intensity, duration and mean annual precipitation (M.A.P.) is defined for the study area The normalised rainfall and the normalised intensity are expressed as a per cent with respect to M.A.P. This threshold is compared with thresholds proposed by other authors, and the comparison shows that a lower value is obtained, indicating the debris-flow susceptibility of the area.

abstract = {A project established at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand is aimed at developing a prototype of a real-time landslide forecasting system. The objective is to predict temporal changes in landslide probability for shallow, rainfall-triggered landslides, based on quantitative weather forecasts from numerical weather prediction models. Global weather forecasts from the United Kingdom Met Office (MO) Numerical Weather Prediction model (NWP) are coupled with a regional data assimilating NWP model (New Zealand Limited Area Model, NZLAM) to forecast atmospheric variables such as precipitation and temperature up to 48 h ahead for all of New Zealand. The weather forecasts are fed into a hydrologic model to predict development of soil moisture and groundwater levels. The forecasted catchment-scale patterns in soil moisture and soil saturation are then downscaled using topographic indices to predict soil moisture status at the local scale, and an infinite slope stability model is applied to determine the triggering soil water threshold at a local scale. The model uses uncertainty of soil parameters to produce probabilistic forecasts of spatio-temporal landslide occurrence 48 h ahead. The system was evaluated for a damaging landslide event in New Zealand. Comparison with landslide densities estimated from satellite imagery resulted in hit rates of 70-90{\%}.},

abstract = {The usefulness of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) as a highly accurate method for determining the soil thickness distribution on hillslopes was validated by combining intensive measurements using invasive methods, i.e., cone penetration testing and boreholes, with ERI in three granitic watersheds. Areas of high electrical resistivity ($\rho$) contrast reflecting soil-bedrock interfaces were found in all three study watersheds. However, $\rho$ values of soil and weathered granite just below the soil mantle varied over a relatively wide range at each site, as well as considerably from site to site. The patterns of low-high contrast in $\rho$ profiles, reflecting the soil-bedrock interface, also differed from site to site despite similarly dry conditions. Differences in the water retention characteristics of soil and weathered granitic bedrock, as found by a previous study of bedrock hydrological properties, may have been a major factor in the observed subsurface $\rho$ variations. The ERI method, with electrode spacing of 0.5 to 2.0m, was successful in determining soil thickness distributions ranging from about 0.5 to 3m depth based on its ability to detect high contrast in $\rho$ in the subsurface zone. Closer electrode spacings are expected to more sensitively reveal the distribution of ground material properties and thus more accurately replicate the soil-bedrock interface. ERI failed to clearly identify the soil-bedrock interface at some points along our measurement lines because of local intermediate materials with different properties such as unconsolidated soil and clayey intermediation just below the soil-bedrock interface. Two types of seismic survey (SS) techniques were also used, combining seismic refraction (SR) and the surface wave method (SWM) with the ERI method in a granitic watershed to compare ERI with other geophysical methods. The profile of S-wave velocity (V s) by SWM also reasonably duplicated the soil-bedrock interface; the V s profile showed larger variation in lateral direction and corresponded to the soil thickness distribution better than the P-wave velocity (V p) profile by SR. The combined use of ERI and SWM may be more effective in detecting the soil-bedrock interface because each method compensates for the deficiencies of the other method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how the spatial correlations between topographic attributes and a soil thickness can be improved by focusing on the relationships between them at specific spatial scales. In addition, this paper examines the effects of the topographic attribute data sources that are used as explanatory variables for modeling the response variable, and considers the possibility of model extrapolation for mapping beyond the area where the model was established. Here, factorial kriging analysis (FKA) and partial least square regression (PLSR) analysis are used to separate nuggets and small- and large-scale structures in data including four topographic attributes and soil thickness (ST). These analyses were conducted at different scales to analyze the relationships between ST and the selected topographic attributes in the southwest region of the Parisian Basin. The structural correlation coefficients from the FKA show strong correlations between the variables. These correlations, which change as a function of spatial scale, are not revealed by the linear correlation coefficients. The Eigen vectors from the principal component analysis that was performed on the small-scale and large-scale structures of the linear co-regionalization model are used to obtain ST and the topographic attributes at both spatial scales over the study area. The ST models are built as a function of topographic attributes using PLSR. Results have shown that the models built using variables that were assessed at a specific scale are better at predicting the target variable than models that were built using raw data. Regarding the models that were built using raw data, the structural correlations that occur at different spatial scales are merged together and the variance–covariance matrix of the nugget that represents data noise is not filtered out. Measures of model performance that are based on a validation data set have shown that the model based on small-scale structure (Model-S) is better for predicting soil thickness than the model based on large-scale structure (Model-L). The effects of topographic attribute data sources as explanatory variables for modeling ST are less significant than the effects of the two models for mapping. Moreover, extrapolation of the model-S beyond the area where it was generated is appropriate. The decomposition process is associated with a modeling approach, such as the PLSR, which accounts for the collinearity between predictor variables and leads to an efficient prediction model. These results are important for modeling soil properties based on topographic attributes and for spatially generalizing models that have been established over small to large areas. Thus, in the presence of nested variogram models, the correlations between variables of interest and auxiliary information should be improved by filtering out some of the spatial structures by factorial kriging. The information filtered is associated with an appropriate approach for modeling when collinearity occurs between the predictor variables and provides a suitable model for predicting and spatially generalizing a locally established model.},

abstract = {The occurrence of shallow landslides is often associated with intense and prolonged rainfall events, where infiltrating water reduces soil strength and may lead to abrupt mass release. Despite general understanding of the role of rainfall water in slope stability, the prediction of rainfall-induced landslides remains a challenge due to natural heterogeneity that affect hydrologic loading patterns and the largely unobservable internal progressive failures. An often overlooked and potentially important factor is the role of rainfall variability in space and time on landslide triggering that is often obscured by coarse information (e.g., hourly radar data at spatial resolution of a few kilometers). To quantify potential effects of rainfall variability on failure dynamics, spatial patterns, landslide numbers and volumes, we employed a physically based “Catchment-scale Hydromechanical Landslide Triggering” (CHLT) model for a study area where a summer storm in 2002 triggered 51 shallow landslides. In numerical experiments based on the CHLT model, we applied the measured rainfall amount of 53 mm in different artificial spatiotemporal rainfall patterns, resulting in between 30 and 100 landslides and total released soil volumes between 3000 and 60,000 m3 for the various scenarios. Results indicate that low intensity rainfall below soil's infiltration capacity resulted in the largest mechanical perturbation. This study illustrates how small-scale rainfall variability that is often overlooked by present operational rainfall data may play a key role in shaping landslide patterns.},

abstract = {Recently, the frequency of rain-triggered landslides in Thailand has been on the increase and has gained momentum, coincident with the effects of climate change. In this regards, the impact of landslide on roads and highways in the hilly and mountainous terrains has also increased. Non-structural landslide mitigation measures, including early warning and hazard mapping, as well as structural mitigation measures with the application of geosynthetics, have been exploited in localities where rain-triggered landslides are a potential threat to human life and property. For early warning, the use of critical Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) is proposed to be most appropriate. Furthermore, deterministic hazard mapping technique incorporating the modern day geospatial technologies can also provide a useful platform to analyze a number of scenarios including rainfall and land cover/land use variations. Finally, a parametric study on a designed and constructed reinforced soil slope with polyester polymer geogrids revealed that the stiffness of backfill is very sensitive to moisture contents or wetting due to rainfall which can influence the performance of reinforced slope structure. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hyperresolution ({\textless}1 km) hydrologic modeling of regional watersheds is expected to support a broad range of terrestrial water cycle studies, but its feasibility is still challenging due to process, data and computational constraints, as well as difficulties in interpreting the high-dimensional dataset of spatiotemporal model forcings and outputs. We address some of these modeling challenges by extending the application of a physically-based, distributed hydrologic model to the R{\'{i}}o San Miguel watershed (3796 km2) in Mexico based on prior efforts that demonstrated the process fidelity at smaller spatiotemporal scales. Long-term (7 year) simulations are conducted at a hyperresolution (∼78 m) over the large domain using parallel simulation capabilities. To address data sparseness, we develop strategies to integrate ground, remotely-sensed and reanalysis data for setting up, forcing and parameterizing the model. Complementary tests with observations at individual stations and remotely-sensed spatial patterns reveal a robust model performance. After building confidence in the model, we interpret the spatiotemporal model forcings and outputs using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) analyses. For all model outputs, a large portion (58–80{\%}) of the spatiotemporal variability can be explained by two dominant EOFs, which are related to model forcings and basin properties. Terrain controls on soil water accumulation have a marked impact on the spatial distribution of most hydrologic variables during the wet season. In addition, soil properties affect soil moisture patterns, while vegetation and elevation distributions influence evapotranspiration and runoff fields. Given the large outputs from long-term hyperresolution simulations, EOF analyses provide a promising avenue for extracting meaningful hydrologic information within complex, regional watersheds.},

The paper starts with an overview of flash floods and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of, and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996???2011) but more extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation. Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective contribution to rainfall, introducing the ?? parameter as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as a multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events. The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values of precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain this positive trend in flash flood events. The ?? parameter has been also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short and local events, usually with daily ?? values above 0.5, while the minimum threshold of daily ?? for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.},

abstract = {Methodologies for developing a macro-scale model of subsurface stormflow generation on a steep forested catchment in Japan are addressed. Field studies on this catchment have indicated that subsurface flow, consisting mainly of 'old' water displaced by 'new' rain water, dominates the storm response. Detailed field measurements on the catchment allowed simple, catchment-scale relationships to be developed between the volume of saturated groundwater, on the one hand, and discharge, and surface and subsurface saturated areas, on the other. Attempts are made to find linkages between these empirical relationships and physically-based descriptions of hydrological processes operating at smaller scales. A distributed model based on the saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow on steep catchments was developed and tested with field data collected on this catchment. Derivation of catchment-scale relationships can be carried out by a straightforward integration of the distributed model output. An alternative disaggregation-aggregation approach is presented, whereby the catchment is divided into a number of hillslope flow strips. By applying the distributed model on each flow strip, under steady-state conditions, it is possible to infer the spatial variability of groundwater volume in the various flow strips. This variability is related to a measure of hillslope topography and geometry. Knowing the catch-ment topography and geometry for any catchment, it is then possible to derive useful catchment-scale relationships which are applicable under quasi-steady-state conditions, Hydrological relationships derived in this manner are compared with corresponding empirical relationships. The methodologies presented are effective for understanding the linkages between catchment scale response and small-scale flow processes.},

Advances in radar hardware, data processing, numerical models, and emerging fields within urban hydrology necessitate an updated review of the state of the art in such radar rainfall data and applications. Three key areas with significant advances over the past decade have been identified: (1) temporal and spatial resolution of rainfall data required for different types of hydrological applications, (2) rainfall estimation, radar data adjustment and data quality, and (3) nowcasting of radar rainfall and real-time applications. Based on these three fields of research, the paper provides recommendations based on an updated overview of shortcomings, gains, and novel developments in relation to urban hydrological applications. The paper also reviews how the focus in urban hydrology research has shifted over the last decade to fields such as climate change impacts, resilience of urban areas to hydrological extremes, and online prediction/warning systems. It is discussed how radar rainfall data can add value to the aforementioned emerging fields in current and future applications, but also to the analysis of integrated water systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Usually, flood frequency analysis in urban areas is indirectly carried out by adopting advanced hydraulic models to simulate long historical rainfall series or design storms. However, their results are affected by a level of uncertainty which has been extensively investigated in recent years. A major source of uncertainty inherent to hydraulic model results is linked to the imperfect knowledge of the rainfall input data both in time and space. Several studies show that hydrological modelling in urban areas requires rainfall data with fine resolution in time and space. The present paper analyses the effect of rainfall knowledge on urban flood modelling results. A mathematical model of urban flooding propagation was applied to a real case study and the maximum efficiency conditions for the model and the uncertainty affecting the results were evaluated by means of generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) analysis. The added value provided by the adoption of finer temporal and spatial resolution of the rainfall was assessed.},

Deterministic and geostatistical interpolation methods were selected to generate time-series of daily and hourly average rainfall over a period of 10 years (2001-2010). These time-series were used as inputs for the HBV-TEC hydrological model and were individually calibrated against observed streamflow data. Based on model results, the performance of the deterministic methods can be said to be comparable to that of the geostatistical methods at daily time-steps.

abstract = {About 50–60{\%} of Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs) including nearly 85{\%} of intense hurricanes have their origins as African Easterly Waves (AEWs). However, predicting the likelihood of AEW intensification remains a difficult task. We have developed a Bayesian diagnostic methodology to understand genesis of North Atlantic TCs spawned by AEWs through the examination of the characteristics of the AEW itself together with the large-scale environment, resulting in a probabilistic discrimination between large-scale environments associated with intensifying and decaying AEWs. The methodology is based on a new objective and automatic AEW tracking scheme used for the period 1980 to 2001 based on spatio-temporally Fourier-filtered relative vorticity and meridional winds at different levels and outgoing long wave radiation. Using the AEW and Hurricane Best Track Files (HURDAT) data sets, probability density functions of environmental variables that discriminate between AEWs that decay, become TCs or become major hurricanes are determined. Results indicate that the initial amplitude of the AEWs is a major determinant for TC genesis, and that TC genesis risk increases when the wave enters an environment characterized by pre-existing large-scale convergence and moist convection. For the prediction of genesis, the most useful variables are column integrated heating, vertical velocity and specific humidity, and a combined form of divergence and vertical velocity and SST. It is also found that the state of the large-scale environment modulates the annual cycle and interannual variability of the AEW intensification efficiency.},

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to estimate the error in the rainfall derived from a polarimetric X-band radar, by comparison with the corresponding estimate of a rain gauge network. However the present analysis also considers the errors inherent to rain gauge, in particular instrumental and representativeness errors. A special emphasis is addressed to the spatial variability of the rainfall in order to appreciate the representativeness error of the rain gauge with respect to the 1 km square average, typical of the radar derived estimate. For this purpose the spatial correlation function of the rainfall is analyzed. The data set consists of 1-year radar data collected by the X-band polarimetric radar HYDRIX??, located in Beauce region (80 km south of Paris). All data were processed in real time using the ZPHI?? algorithm. A dense 25 rain gauge network provided ground comparison data. The various sources of uncertainties (instrumental and representativeness) are then analyzed and quantified for each sensor. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Precipitation is a major input in hydrological models. Radar rainfall data compared with rain gauge measurements provide higher spatial and temporal resolutions. However, radar data obtained form reflectivity patterns are subject to various errors such as errors in reflectivity-rainfall Z-R relationships, variation in vertical profile of reflectivity, and spatial and temporal sampling among others. Characterization of such uncertainties in radar data and their effects on hydrologic simulations is a challenging issue. The superposition of random error of different sources is one of the main factors in uncertainty of radar estimates. One way to express these uncertainties is to stochastically generate random error fields and impose them on radar measurements in order to obtain an ensemble of radar rainfall estimates. In the present study, radar uncertainty is included in the Z-R relationship whereby radar estimates are perturbed with two error components: purely random error and an error component that is proportional to the magnitude of rainfall rates. Parameters of the model are estimated using the maximum likelihood method in order to account for heteroscedasticity in radar rainfall error estimates. An example implementation of this approached is presented to demonstrate the model performance. The results confirm that the model performs reasonably well in generating an ensemble of radar rainfall fields with similar stochastic characteristics and correlation structure to that of unperturbed radar estimates.},

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Hydrologist's traditional tool for measuring rainfall is the rain gauge. Rain gauges are relatively cheap, easy to maintain and provide a direct and suitably accurate estimate of rainfall at a point. What rain gauges fail to capture well is the spatial variability of rainfall with time, an important aspect for the credible modelling of a catchment's response to rainfall. This spatial variability is particularly evident at short timescales of up to several days. As the period of accumulation increases, the expected spatial variability is reduced and rain gauges provide improved spatial rainfall estimates. Because of the fractal variability of rainfall in space, simple interpolation between rain gauges does not provide an accurate estimate of the true spatial rainfall field, at short time scales.Weather radar provides (with a single instrument) a highly detailed representation of the spatial structure and temporal evolution of rainfall over a large area. Estimated rainfall rates are derived indirectly from measurements of reflectivity and are therefore subject to a combination of systematic and random errors.This article describes a recently proposed merging technique and presents an application to simulated rainfall fields. The technique employed is Conditional Merging (Ehret, which makes use of Kriging to extract the optimal information content from the observed data. A mean field based on the Kriged rain gauge data is adopted, while the spatial detail from the radar is retained, reducing bias, but keeping the spatial variability observed by the radar. The variance of the estimate is reduced in the vicinity of the gauges where they are able to provide good information on the true rainfall field. Copyright 2005 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {Satellite rainfall products (SRPs) are becoming more accurate with ever increasing spatial and temporal resolution. This evolution can be beneficial for hydrological applications, providing new sources of information and allowing to drive models in ungauged areas. Despite the large availability of rainfall satellite data, their use in rainfall-runoff modelling is still very scarce, most likely due to measurement issues (bias, accuracy) and the hydrological community acceptability of satellite products. In this study, the real-time version (3B42-RT) of Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis, TMPA, and a new SRP based on the application of SM2RAIN algorithm (Brocca et al., 2014) to the ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) soil moisture product, SM2RASC, are used to drive a lumped hydrologic model over four basins in Italy during the 4-year period 2010???2013. The need of the recalibration of model parameter values for each SRP is highlighted, being an important precondition for their suitable use in flood modelling. Results shows that SRPs provided, in most of the cases, performance scores only slightly lower than those obtained by using observed data with a reduction of Nash???Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) less than 30{\%} when using SM2RASC product while TMPA is characterized by a significant deterioration during the validation period 2012???2013. Moreover, the integration between observed and satellite rainfall data is investigated as well. Interestingly, the simple integration procedure here applied allows obtaining more accurate rainfall input datasets with respect to the use of ground observations only, for 3 out 4 basins. Indeed, discharge simulations improve when ground rainfall observations and SM2RASC product are integrated, with an increase of NS between 2 and 42{\%} for the 3 basins in Central and Northern Italy. Overall, the study highlights the feasibility of using SRPs in hydrological applications over the Mediterranean region with benefits in discharge simulations also in well gauged areas.},

abstract = {Using 30. years (1979-2009) of data from 33 automatic rain gauges in the Netherlands, a study of the space-time variability of rainfall is performed. This study uses 90-day averaged semi-variograms to find seasonal signals in the fitted spherical semi-variogram parameters of rainrates in the Netherlands, for accumulation intervals between 1 and 24. h. These signals can be well-described by simple cosine functions. The dependence of these cosine functions on the accumulation interval is modeled in two different ways: (1) power-law relations between the variogram parameters and the accumulation interval, and (2) power-law relations between the parameters of the cosine functions and the accumulation interval. For the first method the cosine function at the 24-h accumulation interval is also needed. The second of these methods has more parameters, but is shown to model the temporal scaling best. The space-time scaling relations found in this paper are compared to those found by others for similar and contrasting climates. Seasonality is shown to play an important role in determining rainfall spatial variability. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Traditionally, radar reflectivity is transformed into rainfall rates applying a fixed reflectivity - rainfall rate relationship even though this is known to depend on the changing drop size distribution of the specific rain. This creates a transient bias between the radar rainfall and the ground observations due to seasonal changes of the drop size distribution as well as other atmospheric effects and effects related to the radar observational technology. In this study different bias adjustment techniques is investigated, developing a complete 10-year dataset (2002-2012) of high spatio-temporal resolution radar rainfall based on a radar observations from a single C-band radar from Denmark. Results show that hourly adjustment mean field bias adjustment outperform daily mean field bias adjustment with regards to estimation of rainfall totals and peak rain rates.

abstract = {Shallow saturated subsurface flow is a dominant runoff mechanism on hillslopes of headwater catchments under humid temperate climate. Its timing and magnitude is significantly affected by the presence of preferential pathways. Reliable prediction of runoff from hillslope soils under such conditions remains a challenge.In this study, a quantitative relationship between rainfall, stormflow, and leakage to bedrock for hillslopes, where lateral preferential runoff represents a dominant part of the overall response, was sought. Combined effects of temporal rainfall distribution and initial hillslope saturation (antecedent moisture conditions) on stormflow, leakage to bedrock, and overall water balance were evaluated by conducting simulations with synthetic rainfall episodes.A two-dimensional dual-continuum model was used to analyze hydrological processes at an experimental hillslope site located in a small forested headwater catchment.Long-term seasonal simulations with natural rainfall indicated that leakage to bedrock occurred mostly as saturated flow during major runoff events. The amount of rainfall needed to initiate stormflow appeared as a dynamic hillslope property, depending on temporal rainfall distribution, initial hillslope storage, and the spatial distribution of soil water within the hillslope. No single valued rainfall threshold responsible for triggering stormflow was found. Rainfall-stormflow as well as rainfall-leakage relationships were found highly nonlinear for low initial hillslope saturations. Temporal rainfall distribution affected the amount of rainfall necessary to initiate stormflow more than it did the amounts of stormflow or leakage to bedrock. In spite of a simple hillslope geometry with constant slope and parallel soil-atmosphere and soil-bedrock interfaces considered in the analysis, the applied model predicted a hysteretic behavior of storage-discharge relationship.The results showed a mutual interplay of components of hillslope water balance exposing a nonlinear character of the hillslope response. The study provided a quantitatively coherent insight in the hydraulic functioning of hillslopes where preferential flow constitutes a dominant part of stormflow.},

abstract = {Weather radar systems provide detailed information on spatial rainfall patterns known to play a significant role in runoff generation processes. In the current study, we present an innovative approach to exploit spatial rainfall information of air mass thunderstorms and link it with a watershed hydrological model. Observed radar data are decomposed into sets of rain cells conceptualized as circular Gaussian elements and the associated rain cell parameters, namely, location, maximal intensity and decay factor, are input into a hydrological model. Rain cells were retrieved from radar data for several thunderstorms over southern Arizona. Spatial characteristics of the resulting rain fields were evaluated using data from a dense rain gauge network. For an extreme case study in a semi-arid watershed, rain cells were derived and fed as input into a hydrological model to compute runoff response. A major factor in this event was found to be a single intense rain cell (out of the five cells decomposed from the storm). The path of this cell near watershed tributaries and toward the outlet enhanced generation of high flow. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis to cell characteristics indicated that peak discharge could be a factor of two higher if the cell was initiated just a few kilometers aside. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Rainfall-runoff simulations in urban environments require meteorological input data with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The availability of precipitation data is constantly increasing due to the shift towards more open data sharing. However, the applicability of such data for urban runoff assessments is often unknown. Here, the feasibility of Finnish Meteorological Institute's open rain gauge and open weather radar data as input sources was studied by conducting Storm Water Management Model simulations at a very small (33.5 ha) urban catchment in Helsinki, Finland. In addition to the open data sources, data were also available from two research gauges, one of them located on-site, and from a research radar. The results confirmed the importance of local precipitation measurements for urban rainfall-runoff simulations, implying the suitability of open gauge data to be largely dictated by the gauge's distance from the catchment. Performance of open radar data with 5 min and 1 km2 resolution was acceptable in terms of runoff reproduction, albeit peak flows were constantly and flow volumes often underestimated. Gauge adjustment and advection interpolation were found to improve the quality of the radar data, and at least gauge adjustment should be performed when open radar data are used. Finally, utilizing dual-polarization capabilities of radars has a potential to improve rainfall estimates for high intensity storms although more research is still needed.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The performance of urban drainage systems is typically examined using hydrological and hydrodynamic models where rainfall input is uniformly distributed, i.e., derived from a single or very few rain gauges. When models are fed with a single uniformly distributed rainfall realization, the response of the urban drainage system to the rainfall variability remains unexplored. The goal of this study was to understand how climate variability and spatial rainfall variability, jointly or individually considered, affect the response of a calibrated hydrodynamic urban drainage model. A stochastic spatially distributed rainfall generator (STREAP {\&}ndash; {\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}S{\textless}/span{\textgreater}pace-{\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}T{\textless}/span{\textgreater}ime {\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}Re{\textless}/span{\textgreater}alizations of {\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}A{\textless}/span{\textgreater}real {\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}P{\textless}/span{\textgreater}recipitation) was used to simulate many realizations of rainfall for a 30-year period, accounting for both climate variability and spatial rainfall variability. The generated rainfall ensemble was used as input into a calibrated hydrodynamic model (EPA SWMM {\&}ndash; the US EPA's Storm Water Management Model) to simulate surface runoff and channel flow in a small urban catchment in the city of Lucerne, Switzerland. The variability of peak flows in response to rainfall of different return periods was evaluated at three different locations in the urban drainage network and partitioned among its sources. The main contribution to the total flow variability was found to originate from the natural climate variability (on average over 74 {\%}). In addition, the relative contribution of the spatial rainfall variability to the total flow variability was found to increase with longer return periods. This suggests that while the use of spatially distributed rainfall data can supply valuable information for sewer network design (typically based on rainfall with return periods from 5 to 15 years), there is a more pronounced relevance when conducting flood risk assessments for larger return periods. The results show the importance of using multiple distributed rainfall realizations in urban hydrology studies to capture the total flow variability in the response of the urban drainage systems to heavy rainfall events.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {No consensus has yet been reached regarding the influence of rainfall spatial variability on runoff modelling at catchment outlets. To eliminate modelling and measurement errors, in addition to controlling rainfall variability and both the characteristics and hydrological behaviour of catchments, we propose to proceed by simulation. We have developed a simulation chain that combines a stream network model, a rainfall simulator and a distributed hydrological model (with four production functions and a distributed transfer function). Our objective here is to use this simulation chain as a simplified test bed in order to better understand the impact of the spatial variability of rainfall forcing. We applied the chain to contrasted situations involving catchments ranging from a few tens to several hundreds of square km2, thus corresponding to urban and peri-urban catchments for which surface runoff constitutes the dominant process. The results obtained confirm that the proposed simulation approach is helpful to better understand the influence of rainfall spatial variability on the catchment response. We have shown that significant dispersion exists not only between the various simulation scenarios (defined by a rainfall configuration and a catchment configuration), but also within each simulation scenario. These results show that the organisation of rainfall during the study event over the study catchment plays an important role, leading us to examine rainfall variability indexes capable of summarising the influence of rainfall spatial organisation on the catchment response. Thanks to the simulation chain, we have tested the variability indexes of Zoccatelli et al. (2010) and improved them by proposing two other indexes.},

The study described in this paper uses wind fields determined using Doppler radar to estimate the trajectories of falling drops and thereby assess the error induced in surface rainfall rate that is found using radar observations of precipitation aloft. The authors examine real data as well as using that data to simulate changes created by changing resolution and radar beam height. The results show how great the errors could be under certain circumstances. This is particularly the case with high-resolution observations and situations involving low-level directional wind shear. This leads to a comprehension of the complexity of correcting those errors, as determining the trajectory of drops requires detailed knowledge of wind profiles. These profiles may vary on small spatial and temporal scales, especially during the kind of convective episodes for which wind-drift is most likely to cause the greatest uncertainty in retrieved rainfall. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Rainfall estimates of the highest possible accuracy and resolution are required for urban hydrological applications, given the small size and fast response which characterise urban catchments. While radar rainfall estimates have the advantage of well capturing the spatial structure of rainfall fields and its variation in time, the commonly available radar rainfall products (typically at {\~{}}1 km/5-10 min resolution) may still fail to satisfy the accuracy and resolution - in particular temporal resolution - requirements of urban hydrology. A methodology is proposed in this paper, to produce higher temporal resolution, more accurate radar rainfall estimates, suitable for urban hydrological applications. The proposed methodology entails two main steps: (1) Temporal interpolation of radar images from the originally-available temporal resolutions (i.e. 5-10 min) to finer resolutions at which local rain gauge data are commonly available (i.e. 1-2 min). This is done using a novel interpolation technique, based upon the multi-scale variational optical flow technique, and which can well capture the small-scale rainfall structures relevant at urban scales. (2) Local and dynamic gauge-based adjustment of the higher temporal resolution radar rainfall estimates is performed afterwards, by means of the Bayesian data merging method. The proposed methodology is tested using as case study a total of 8 storm events observed in the Cranbrook (UK) and Herent (BE) urban catchments, for which radar rainfall estimates, local rain gauge and depth/flow records, as well as recently calibrated urban drainage models were available. The results suggest that the proposed methodology can provide significantly improved radar rainfall estimates and thereby generate more accurate runoff simulations at urban scales, over and above the benefits derived from the mere application of Bayesian merging at the original temporal resolution at which radar estimates are available. The benefits of the proposed temporal interpolation + merging methodology are particularly evident in storm events with strong and fast-changing (convective-like) rain cells.},

@article{Ly2011,
abstract = {Spatial interpolation of precipitation data is of great importance for hydrological modelling. Geostatistical methods (kriging) are widely applied in spatial interpolation from point measurement to continuous surfaces. The first step in kriging computation is the semi-variogram modelling which usually used only one variogram model for all-moment data. The objective of this paper was to develop different algorithms of spatial interpolation for daily rainfall on 1 km² regular grids in the catchment area and to compare the results of geostatistical and deterministic approaches. This study leaned on 30-yr daily rainfall data of 70 raingages in the hilly landscape of the Ourthe and Ambleve catchments in Belgium (2908 km²). This area lies between 35 and 693m in elevation and consists of river net- works, which are tributaries of the Meuse River. For geostatistical algorithms, seven semi-variogram models (logarithmic, power, exponential, Gaussian, rational quadratic, spherical and penta-spherical) were fitted to daily sample semi-variogram on a daily basis. These seven variogram models were also adopted to avoid negative interpolated rainfall. The elevation, extracted from a digital elevation model, was incorporated into multivariate geostatistics. Seven validation raingages and cross validation were used to compare the interpolation performance of these algorithms applied to different densities of raingages. We found that between the seven variogram models used, the Gaussian model was the most frequently best fit. Using seven variogram models can avoid negative daily rainfall in ordinary kriging. The negative estimates of kriging were observed for convective more than stratiform rain. The performance of the different methods varied slightly according to the density of raingages, particularly between 8 and 70 raingages but it was much different for interpolation using 4 raingages. Spatial interpolation with the geostatistical and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) algorithms outperformed considerably the interpolation with the Thiessen polygon, commonly used in various hydrological models. Integrating elevation into Kriging with an External Drift (KED) and Ordinary Cokriging (OCK) did not improve the interpolation accuracy for daily rainfall. Ordinary Kriging (ORK) and IDWwere considered to be the best methods, as they provided smallest RMSE value for nearly all cases. Care should be taken in applying UNK and KED when interpolating daily rainfall with very few neighbourhood sample points. These recommendations complement the results reported in the literature. ORK, UNK and KED using only spherical model offered a slightly better result whereas OCK using seven variogram models achieved better result.

abstract = {It is generally acknowledged that in order to apply radar rainfall data for hydrological proposes adjustment against ground observations are crucial. Traditionally, radar reflectivity is transformed into rainfall rates applying a fixed reflectivity - rainfall rate relationship even though this is known to depend on the changing drop size distribution of the specific rain. This creates a transient bias between the radar rainfall and the ground observations due to seasonal changes of the drop size distribution as well as other atmospheric effects and effects related to the radar observational technology. In this study different bias adjustment techniques is investigated, developing a complete 10-year dataset (2002-2012) of high spatio-temporal resolution radar rainfall based on a radar observations from a single C-band radar from Denmark. Results show that hourly adjustment mean field bias adjustment outperform daily mean field bias adjustment with regards to estimation of rainfall totals and peak rain rates. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that radar rainfall estimates can be improved significantly by implementation of a novel advection interpolation technique. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {This study uses a long-term (8years) dataset of radar-rainfall and runoff observations for the Tar River Basin in North Carolina, to explore the rainfall space-time organization control on the flood response of mild-slope (max slope {\textless}32 degrees) basins. We employ the concepts of "spatial moments of catchment rainfall" and "catchment scale storm velocity" to quantify the effect of spatial rainfall variability and basin geomorphology on flood response. A calibrated distributed hydrologic model is employed to assess the relevance of these statistics in describing the degree of spatial rainfall organization, which is important for runoff modeling. Furthermore, the Tar River Basin is divided into four nested sub-basins ranging from 1106km2 to 5654km2, in order to investigate the scale dependence of results. The rainfall spatiotemporal distribution represented in the analytical framework is shown to describe well the differences in hydrograph timing (less so in terms of magnitude of the simulated hydrographs) determined from forcing the hydrologic model with lumped vs. distributed rainfall. Specifically, the first moment exhibits a linear relationship with the difference in timing between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing. The analysis shows that the catchment scale storm velocity is scale dependent in terms of variability and rainfall dependent in terms of its value, assuming typically small values. Accordingly, the error in dispersion of simulated hydrographs between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing is relatively insensitive to the catchment scale storm velocity, which is attributed to the spatial variability of routing and hillslope velocities that is not accounted by the conceptual framework used in this study. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban catchments are typically characterised by high spatial variability and fast runoff processes resulting in short response times. Hydrological analysis of such catchments requires high resolution precipitation and catchment information to properly represent catchment response. This study investigated the impact of rainfall input resolution on the outputs of detailed hydrodynamic models of seven urban catchments in North-West Europe. The aim was to identify critical rainfall resolutions for urban catchments to properly characterise catchment response. Nine storm events measured by a dual-polarimetric X-band weather radar, located in the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR) of the Netherlands, were selected for analysis. Based on the original radar estimates, at 100 m and 1 min resolutions, 15 different combinations of coarser spatial and temporal resolutions, up to 3000 m and 10 min, were generated. These estimates were then applied to the operational semi-distributed hydrodynamic models of the urban catchments, all of which have similar size (between 3 and 8 km2), but different morphological, hydrological and hydraulic characteristics. When doing so, methodologies for standardising model outputs and making results comparable were implemented. Results were analysed in the light of storm and catchment characteristics. Three main features were observed in the results: (1) the impact of rainfall input resolution decreases rapidly as catchment drainage area increases; (2) in general, variations in temporal resolution of rainfall inputs affect hydrodynamic modelling results more strongly than variations in spatial resolution; (3) there is a strong interaction between the spatial and temporal resolution of rainfall input estimates. Based upon these results, methods to quantify the impact of rainfall input resolution as a function of catchment size and spatial-temporal characteristics of storms are proposed and discussed.},

abstract = {Although it is broadly acknowledged that the radar-rainfall (RR) estimates based on the U. S. national network of Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) stations contain a high degree of uncertainty, no methods currently exist to inform users about its quantitative characteristics. The most comprehensive characterization of this uncertainty can be achieved by delivering the products in a probabilistic rather than the traditional deterministic form. The authors are developing a methodology for probabilistic quantitative precipitation estimation (PQPE) based on weather radar data. In this study, they present the central element of this methodology: an empirically based error structure model for the RR products. The authors apply a product-error-driven (PED) approach to obtain a realistic uncertainty model. It is based on the analyses of six years of data from the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, WSR-88D radar (KTLX) processed with the Precipitation Processing System algorithm of the NEXRAD system. The modeled functional-statistical relationship between RR estimates and corresponding true rainfall consists of two components: a systematic distortion function and a stochastic factor quantifying remaining random errors. The two components are identified using a nonparametric functional estimation apparatus. The true rainfall is approximated with rain gauge data from the Oklahoma Mesonet and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service Micronet networks. The RR uncertainty model presented here accounts for different time scales, synoptic regimes, and distances from the radar.

abstract = {Precipitation is a major input in hydrological models. Radar rainfall data compared with rain gauge measurements provide higher spatial and temporal resolutions. However, radar data obtained form reflectivity patterns are subject to various errors such as errors in reflectivity-rainfall Z-R relationships, variation in vertical profile of reflectivity, and spatial and temporal sampling among others. Characterization of such uncertainties in radar data and their effects on hydrologic simulations is a challenging issue. The superposition of random error of different sources is one of the main factors in uncertainty of radar estimates. One way to express these uncertainties is to stochastically generate random error fields and impose them on radar measurements in order to obtain an ensemble of radar rainfall estimates. In the present study, radar uncertainty is included in the Z-R relationship whereby radar estimates are perturbed with two error components: purely random error and an error component that is proportional to the magnitude of rainfall rates. Parameters of the model are estimated using the maximum likelihood method in order to account for heteroscedasticity in radar rainfall error estimates. An example implementation of this approached is presented to demonstrate the model performance. The results confirm that the model performs reasonably well in generating an ensemble of radar rainfall fields with similar stochastic characteristics and correlation structure to that of unperturbed radar estimates.},

abstract = {This paper examines the sensitivity of a hydrological model to several methods of spatial interpolation of rainfall data. The question is investigated in a context of scarcity of data over a large West African catchment (100,000 km2) subject to a drastic trend of rain deficit since the 1970s. Thirteen widely scattered rainfall stations and their daily time series were used to interpolate gridded rainfall surfaces over the 1950-1992 period via various methods: Thiessen polygons, inverse distance weighted (IDW) method, thin smooth plate splines (spline), and ordinary kriging. The accuracy of these interpolated datasets was evaluated using two complementary approaches. First, a point-by-point assessment was conducted, involving comparison of the interpolated values by reference to observed point data. Second, a conceptual rainfall-runoff model (Hydrostrahler) was used in order to assess whether and to what extent the alternative sets of interpolated rainfall impacted on the hydrological simulations. A lumped modelling exercise over a long period (1952-1992) and a semi-distributed exercise over a short period (1971-1976) were performed, using calibrations aimed at optimizing a Nash-Sutcliffe criterion. The results were evaluated for each interpolated forcing dataset using statistical analysis and visual inspection of the simulated and observed hydrographs and the parameters obtained from calibration. Assessment of the interpolation methods by reference to point data indicates that interpolations using the IDW and kriging methods are more efficient than the simple Thiessen technique, and, to a lesser extent, than spline. The use of these data in a daily lumped modelling application shows a different ranking of the various interpolation methods with regard to various hydrological assessments. The model is particularly sensitive to the differences in the rainfall input volume produced by each interpolation method: the IDW dataset yields the highest hydrological efficiency while the spline dataset gets the poorest results. Although the calibration procedure makes it possible to partly compensate for the differences (or errors) between rain input datasets, the semi-distributed hydrological model remains sensitive to volumetric and spatial differences. Then, assessment of these combined differences through the sensitivity of the semi-distributed model provides us with more complete discrimination between the interpolated data inputs. The output results at the basin outlet do not decrease between the lumped and semi-distributed modelling exercises with the IDW and kriging datasets, in contrast to the Thiessen and spline datasets, which tends to indicate the superiority of the former two interpolated inputs. In this hydrological application, the IDW dataset is still shown to provide the most realistic results. Moreover, despite the scarcity of rainfall data, coherent semi-distributed values of the model parameters are obtained by calibration over a large gradient of climate conditions. Finally, it is observed that although the model reproduced the rainfall-runoff relationship before 1970 very well, regardless of which interpolated datasets were used, it was not able to satisfactorily simulate the basin behaviour after the change in rainfall regime. This inability needs further investigation and is the subject of ongoing research. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Satellite rainfall products (SRPs) are becoming more accurate with ever increasing spatial and temporal resolution. This evolution can be beneficial for hydrological applications, providing new sources of information and allowing to drive models in ungauged areas. Despite the large availability of rainfall satellite data, their use in rainfall-runoff modelling is still very scarce, most likely due to measurement issues (bias, accuracy) and the hydrological community acceptability of satellite products. In this study, the real-time version (3B42-RT) of Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis, TMPA, and a new SRP based on the application of SM2RAIN algorithm (Brocca et al., 2014) to the ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) soil moisture product, SM2RASC, are used to drive a lumped hydrologic model over four basins in Italy during the 4-year period 2010???2013. The need of the recalibration of model parameter values for each SRP is highlighted, being an important precondition for their suitable use in flood modelling. Results shows that SRPs provided, in most of the cases, performance scores only slightly lower than those obtained by using observed data with a reduction of Nash???Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) less than 30{\%} when using SM2RASC product while TMPA is characterized by a significant deterioration during the validation period 2012???2013. Moreover, the integration between observed and satellite rainfall data is investigated as well. Interestingly, the simple integration procedure here applied allows obtaining more accurate rainfall input datasets with respect to the use of ground observations only, for 3 out 4 basins. Indeed, discharge simulations improve when ground rainfall observations and SM2RASC product are integrated, with an increase of NS between 2 and 42{\%} for the 3 basins in Central and Northern Italy. Overall, the study highlights the feasibility of using SRPs in hydrological applications over the Mediterranean region with benefits in discharge simulations also in well gauged areas.},

abstract = {This study evaluated rainfall estimates from ground radar network and four satellite algorithms with a relatively dense rain gauge network over Taiwan Island for the 2009 extreme Typhoon Morakot at various spatiotemporal scales (from 0.04° to 0.25° and hourly to event total accumulation). The results show that all the remote-sensing products underestimate the rainfall as compared to the rain gauge measurements, in an order of radar (-18{\%}), 3B42RT (-19{\%}), PERSIANN-CCS (28{\%}), 3B42V6 (-36{\%}), and CMORPH (-61{\%}). The ground radar estimates are also most correlated with gauge measurements, having a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.81 (0.82) at 0.04° (0.25°) spatial resolution. For satellite products, CMORPH has the best spatial correlation (0.70) but largely underestimates the total rainfall accumulation. Compared to microwave ingested algorithms, the IR-dominant algorithms provide a better estimation of the total rainfall accumulation but poorly resolve the temporal evolution of the warm cloud typhoon, especially for a large overestimation at the early storm stage. This study suggests that the best performance comes from the ground radar estimates that could be used as an alternative in case of the gauge denial. However, the current satellite rainfall products still have limitations in terms of resolution and accuracy, especially for this type of extreme typhoon. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban flash flooding is a serious problem in large, highly populated areas such as the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW). Being able to monitor and predict flash flooding at a high spatiotemporal resolution is critical to providing location-specific early warnings and cost-effective emergency management in such areas. Under the idealized conditions of perfect models and precipitation input, one may expect that spatiotemporal specificity and accuracy of the model output improve as the resolution of the models and precipitation input increases. In reality, however, due to the errors in the precipitation input, and in the structures, parameters and states of the models, there are practical limits to the model resolution. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of streamflow simulation in urban catchments to the spatiotemporal resolution of precipitation input and hydrologic modeling to identify the resolution at which the simulation errors may be at minimum given the quality of the precipitation input and hydrologic models used, and the response time of the catchment. The hydrologic modeling system used in this work is the National Weather Service (NWS) Hydrology Laboratory's Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HLRDHM) applied at spatiotemporal resolutions ranging from 250 m to 2 km and from 1 min to 1 h applied over the Cities of Fort Worth, Arlington and Grand Prairie in DFW. The high-resolution precipitation input is from the DFW Demonstration Network of the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) radars. For comparison, the NWS Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE) product, which is available at a 4-km 1-h resolution, was also used. The streamflow simulation results are evaluated for 5 urban catchments ranging in size from 3.4 to 54.6 km2 and from about 45 min to 3 h in time-to-peak in the Cities of Fort Worth, Arlington and Grand Prairie. The streamflow observations used in evaluation were obtained from water level measurements via rating curves derived from 1-D steady-state non-uniform hydraulic modeling. The results indicate that a spatiotemporal resolution of 500 m and 15 min or higher is a good choice for streamflow prediction using HLRDHM and CASA QPE in the study area, but that, due to the nonlinear accretion of random errors in QPE and imperfect model dynamics, there are trade-offs to consider among resolution, timeliness of prediction and prediction accuracy.},

@article{Sinclair2005,
abstract = {The Hydrologist's traditional tool for measuring rainfall is the rain gauge. Rain gauges are relatively cheap, easy to maintain and provide a direct and suitably accurate estimate of rainfall at a point. What rain gauges fail to capture well is the spatial variability of rainfall with time, an important aspect for the credible modelling of a catchment's response to rainfall. This spatial variability is particularly evident at short timescales of up to several days. As the period of accumulation increases, the expected spatial variability is reduced and rain gauges provide improved spatial rainfall estimates. Because of the fractal variability of rainfall in space, simple interpolation between rain gauges does not provide an accurate estimate of the true spatial rainfall field, at short time scales.Weather radar provides (with a single instrument) a highly detailed representation of the spatial structure and temporal evolution of rainfall over a large area. Estimated rainfall rates are derived indirectly from measurements of reflectivity and are therefore subject to a combination of systematic and random errors.This article describes a recently proposed merging technique and presents an application to simulated rainfall fields. The technique employed is Conditional Merging (Ehret, which makes use of Kriging to extract the optimal information content from the observed data. A mean field based on the Kriged rain gauge data is adopted, while the spatial detail from the radar is retained, reducing bias, but keeping the spatial variability observed by the radar. The variance of the estimate is reduced in the vicinity of the gauges where they are able to provide good information on the true rainfall field. Copyright 2005 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {This study aims to assess the impact of a class of radar rainfall errors on prediction uncertainty of a conceptual water balance model. Uncertainty assessment is canied out by means of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation procedure (GLUE). The effects of model input and structural error are separated, and the potential for compensating errors between them is investigated. It is shown that the radar rainfall bias term operates in a multiplicative sense on the model structural uncertainty, by either magnimg or reducing it according to the sign of the bias. The results show also that adjustment of radar rainfall, aimed to remove local biases and to reduce random errors, allows ensunng that a larger percentage of the observed flows are enclosed by the uncertainty bounds, with respect to nonadjusted radar input. However, this is obtained at the pnce of increasing the wideness of the uncertainty bounds. This effect is emphasized with increasing the radar beam elevation. As a second step, the issue of the impact of radar rainfall estimation error on model parameter distribution and parameter transferability across sites under the radar umbrella is examined. Radar data at different radar beam elevations are used to simulate radar estimation errors at different distances from the radar site and to analyze the impact of these errors on prediction uncertainty. The results show that distortion of parameter distribution due to radar error may be considerable and that adjustment of radar rainfall estimates improves the regionalization potential of radarbased precipitation estimates (at least for ranges less than 70 km).},

abstract = {This work presents the results of the implementation of a probabilistic system to model the uncertainty associated to radar rainfall (RR) estimates and the way this uncertainty propagates through the sewer system of an urban area located in the North of England. The spatial and temporal correlations of the RR errors as well as the error covariance matrix were computed to build a RR error model able to generate RR ensembles that reproduce the uncertainty associated with the measured rainfall. The results showed that the RR ensembles provide important information about the uncertainty in the rainfall measurement that can be propagated in the urban sewer system. The results showed that the measured flow peaks and flow volumes are often bounded within the uncertainty area produced by the RR ensembles. In 55{\%} of the simulated events, the uncertainties in RR measurements can explain the uncertainties observed in the simulated flow volumes. However, there are also some events where the RR uncertainty cannot explain the whole uncertainty observed in the simulated flow volumes indicating that there are additional sources of uncertainty that must be considered such as the uncertainty in the urban drainage model structure, the uncertainty in the urban drainage model calibrated parameters, and the uncertainty in the measured sewer flows.},

abstract = {Cities are increasingly vulnerable to floods generated by intense rainfall, because of urbanisation of flood-prone areas and ongoing urban densification. Accurate information of convective storm characteristics at high spatial and temporal resolution is a crucial input for urban hydrological models to be able to simulate fast runoff processes and enhance flood prediction in cities. In this paper, a detailed study of the sensitivity of urban hydrodynamic response to high resolution radar rainfall was conducted. Rainfall rates derived from X-band dual polarimetric weather radar were used as input into a detailed hydrodynamic sewer model for an urban catchment in the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The aim was to characterise how the effect of space and time aggregation on rainfall structure affects hydrodynamic modelling of urban catchments, for resolutions ranging from 100 to 2000 m and from 1 to 10 min. Dimensionless parameters were derived to compare results between different storm conditions and to describe the effect of rainfall spatial resolution in relation to storm characteristics and hydrodynamic model properties: rainfall sampling number (rainfall resolution vs. storm size), catchment sampling number (rainfall resolution vs. catchment size), runoff and sewer sampling number (rainfall resolution vs. runoff and sewer model resolution respectively). {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Results show that for rainfall resolution lower than half the catchment size, rainfall volumes mean and standard deviations decrease as a result of smoothing of rainfall gradients. Moreover, deviations in maximum water depths, from 10 to 30{\%} depending on the storm, occurred for rainfall resolution close to storm size, as a result of rainfall aggregation. Model results also showed that modelled runoff peaks are more sensitive to rainfall resolution than maximum in-sewer water depths as flow routing has a damping effect on in-sewer water level variations. Temporal resolution aggregation of rainfall inputs led to increase in de-correlation lengths and resulted in time shift in modelled flow peaks by several minutes. Sensitivity to temporal resolution of rainfall inputs was low compared to spatial resolution, for the storms analysed in this study.},

abstract = {Precipitation is often the most important input data in hydrological models when simulating streamflow. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a widely used hydrological model, only makes use of data from one precipitation gauge station that is nearest to the centroid of each subbasin, which is eventually corrected using the elevation band method. This leads in general to inaccurate representation of subbasin precipitation input data, particularly in catchments with complex topography. To investigate the impact of different precipitation inputs on the SWAT model simulations in Alpine catchments, 13??years (1998???2010) of daily precipitation data from four datasets including OP (Observed precipitation), IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting data), CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) and TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) has been considered. Both model performances (comparing simulated and measured streamflow data at the catchment outlet) as well as parameter and prediction uncertainties have been quantified. For all three subbasins, the use of elevation bands is fundamental to match the water budget. Streamflow predictions obtained using IDW inputs are better than those obtained using the other datasets in terms of both model performance and prediction uncertainty. Models using the CHIRPS product as input provide satisfactory streamflow estimation, suggesting that this satellite product can be applied to this data-scarce Alpine region. Comparing the performance of SWAT models using different precipitation datasets is therefore important in data-scarce regions. This study has shown that, precipitation is the main source of uncertainty, and different precipitation datasets in SWAT models lead to different best estimate ranges for the calibrated parameters. This has important implications for the interpretation of the simulated hydrological processes.},

abstract = {Using 30. years (1979-2009) of data from 33 automatic rain gauges in the Netherlands, a study of the space-time variability of rainfall is performed. This study uses 90-day averaged semi-variograms to find seasonal signals in the fitted spherical semi-variogram parameters of rainrates in the Netherlands, for accumulation intervals between 1 and 24. h. These signals can be well-described by simple cosine functions. The dependence of these cosine functions on the accumulation interval is modeled in two different ways: (1) power-law relations between the variogram parameters and the accumulation interval, and (2) power-law relations between the parameters of the cosine functions and the accumulation interval. For the first method the cosine function at the 24-h accumulation interval is also needed. The second of these methods has more parameters, but is shown to model the temporal scaling best. The space-time scaling relations found in this paper are compared to those found by others for similar and contrasting climates. Seasonality is shown to play an important role in determining rainfall spatial variability. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {s u m m a r y This work aims to evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of radar rainfall estimates for the iden-tification of debris flow occurrence rainfall thresholds. Observations from a C-band weather radar and raingauge data are analyzed for seven convective rainfall events that triggered 117 debris flows in the Upper Adige river basin (Eastern Italian Alps). Four radar rainfall scenarios characterized by incremen-tally increasing accuracy are used for the estimation of rainfall intensity–duration thresholds. Error sources considered in the radar correction chain include beam blockage, attenuation and vertical profile of reflectivity. The impact of rainfall accuracy on the estimation of the intensity–duration thresholds is analyzed by comparing the thresholds derived from the various radar rainfall scenarios, using the rainfall estimates obtained from the application of the complete correction algorithm as a reference scenario. Results show that the application of the complete correction algorithm improves significantly the accu-racy of radar rainfall estimates: Fractional Standard Error is decreased by 20{\%}, Correlation Coefficient is increased by 24{\%} relative to uncorrected data. Correction for atmospheric attenuation is the most impor-tant step in the correction chain. The use of uncorrected radar estimates leads to substantially underes-timated thresholds with respect to the reference scenario; adjusting radar data for bias is not sufficient to overcome this problem. Radar rainfall estimates which are corrected but not adjusted with raingauge data are able to provide intensity–duration thresholds which are almost indistinguishable from the ref-erence scenario. The derivation of the radar-based threshold is shown to be very sensitive to spatial loca-tion errors of rainfall and debris flows. Raingauge-based thresholds are severely underestimated with respect to the reference scenario. This clearly demonstrates the severity of the raingauge-based estima-tion problem for the derivation of debris flow triggering rainfall and highlights the benefits of using weather radar observations, at least for the case of short duration convective storms.},

In this study we quantify the impact of rainfall spatial and temporal structure on the catchment hydrological response based on a numerical experiment. Rainfall ensembles generated using a state-of-the-art space-time stochastic model are used as input into a distributed process-based hydrological model. The sensitivity of the hydrograph to several structural characteristics of storm rainfall for three soil moisture initial conditions is numerically assessed at the basin outlet of an Alpine catchment in central Switzerland. The results highlight that the flood response is strongly affected by the temporal correlation of rainfall and to a lesser extent by its spatial variability. Initial soil moisture conditions play a paramount role in mediating the response. We identify the underlying mechanistic explanations in terms of runoff generation and connectivity of saturated areas that determine the sensitivity of flood response to the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall. We show that the element that mostly influences both the flood peak and the time of peak occurrence is the clustering of saturated areas in the catchment which leads to local enhanced runoff. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The forecast of debris flow occurrence relies mainly on empirical rainfall intensity-duration thresholds, which are based on rain gauge observations. This work focuses on the effect of rainfall estimation uncertainty on the estimation of debris flow triggering rainfall events and on the identification of rainfall thresholds for debris flow occurrence. Specifically, the influence of rain gauge network density and the interpolation method on the estimation of debris flow triggering rainfall is investigated. These questions are examined using high-resolution, carefully corrected radar data to represent space-time patterns of true precipitation at the debris flow initiation points and in the surrounding area. Radar rainfall fields are sampled by simulated rain gauge networks, stochastically generated with varying rain gauge densities. Based on these networks, rainfall is estimated by using three rainfall interpolation methods: nearest neighbor (NN), inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK). Results show that NN provides the estimates with bias smaller than IDW and OK but larger estimation variance. Overall, decrease in gauge density leads to increased underestimation and increased estimation variance of debris flow triggering rainfall. Rainfall estimation error leads to large underestimation of the intensity-duration thresholds. However, comparison of results shows that no particular benefit in intensity-duration threshold estimation is obtained by using approaches that are more complex than the NN method.},

abstract = {Ground-based precipitation data are still the dominant input type for hydrological models. Spatial variability in precipitation can be represented by spatially interpolating gauge data using various techniques. In this study, the effect of daily precipitation interpolation methods on discharge simulations using the semi-distributed SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model over a 30-year period is examined. The study was carried out in 11 meso-scale (119–3935 km2) sub-catchments lying in the Sulej{\'{o}}w reservoir catchment in central Poland. Four methods were tested: the default SWAT method (Def) based on the Nearest Neighbour technique, Thiessen Polygons (TP), Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK). =The evaluation of methods was performed using a semi-automated calibration program SUFI-2 (Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Procedure Version 2) with two objective functions: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the adjusted R2 coefficient (bR2). The results show that: (1) the most complex OK method outperformed other methods in terms of NSE; and (2) OK, IDW, and TP outperformed Def in terms of bR2. The median difference in daily/monthly NSE between OK and Def/TP/IDW calculated across all catchments ranged between 0.05 and 0.15, while the median difference between TP/IDW/OK and Def ranged between 0.05 and 0.07. The differences between pairs of interpolation methods were, however, spatially variable and a part of this variability was attributed to catchment properties: catchments characterised by low station density and low coefficient of variation of daily flows experienced more pronounced improvement resulting from using interpolation methods. Methods providing higher precipitation estimates often resulted in a better model performance. The implication from this study is that appropriate consideration of spatial precipitation variability (often neglected by model users) that can be achieved using relatively simple interpolation methods can significantly improve the reliability of model simulations.},

abstract = {The topic of this paper is temporal interpolation of precipitation observed by weather radars. Precipitation measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution are, in general, desired for urban drainage applications. An advection-based interpolation method is developed which uses methods for vector field estimation already known from short-term weather radar nowcasting. However, instead of forecasting the weather radar rainfall, the proposed interpolation method exploits the advection of the rainfall in the interpolation. The interpolated rainfall fields are validated by measurements at ground level from laser disdrometers. The proposed interpolation method performs better when compared to traditional interpolation of weather radar rainfall where the radar observation is considered constant in time between measurements. It is demonstrated that the advection-based interpolation method reconstructs a significant part of the temporal variations of the rainfall. Moreover, the interpolated precipitation fields estimate accumulated rain depths more accurately. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Radar rainfall has received growing attention in the urban drainage community since its first appearance on an Urban Storm Drainage Conference in 1984. Still, operational applications of radar rainfall in urban hydrology is limited. The following aspects have to be considered for radar rainfall data use specifically in urban hydrology: the type of the radar, the application requirements on the radar data, the achievable radar data quality, forecast possibilities and limits. Quantitative applications of weather radar to urban hydrology are becoming more mature with better understanding of limitations and achievable accuracy. Research in the US and Europe has led to operational applications of radar to site-specific forecasting of floods and management of sewer overflow during wet weather. The uncertainties and methods for obtaining accurate rainfall measurements at high resolution and with areal extents consistent with urban catchments is a major focus of this article. Evaluation and improvement of quantitative precipitation measurements are described in this overview with specific research and operational examples of radar use in urban hydrology. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spatial interpolation of climatic data is frequently required to provide input for plant growth models. As no single method is optimal for all regions, it is important to compare the results obtained using alternative methods applied to each data set. For estimating 30-year averages (Normals) of monthly temperature and precipitation at speci{\textregistered}c sites in western Canada, we examined four forms of kriging and three simple alternatives. One of the alternatives was a novel technique, termed `gradientplus- inverse distance squared' (GIDS), which combines multiple linear regression and distance-weighting. Based on the mean absolute errors from cross-validation tests, the methods were ranked GIDS {\textgreater} detrended kriging {\textgreater} nearest neighbour {\textgreater}cokriging {\textgreater} inverse distance squared {\textgreater} universal kriging {\textgreater} ordinary kriging for interpolating monthly temperature, and GIDS {\textgreater} co-kriging{\textgreater}inverse distance squared {\textgreater} nearest neighbour {\textgreater} ordinary kriging {\textgreater} detrended kriging {\textgreater} universal kriging for interpolating monthly precipitation. GIDS gave the lowest errors, which averaged 0.58C for monthly temperature and 3.6 mm, or 11{\%}, for monthly precipitation. These errors were comparable with those from optimal methods in other studies. GIDS errors were also more consistent for a wide range of data variability than the other methods. The performance of kriging may have been constrained by the limited number of stations (32) in the study region, but if so, this is an unavoidable limitation in regions with sparse coverage of climate stations. Compared with kriging, GIDS was simple to apply and avoided the subjectivity involved in de{\textregistered}ning variogram models and neighbourhoods. We conclude that GIDS is a simple, robust and accurate interpolation method for use in our region, and that it should be applicable elsewhere, subject to careful comparison with other methods.},

abstract = {This work aims to evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of radar rainfall estimates for the identification of debris flow occurrence rainfall thresholds. Observations from a C-band weather radar and raingauge data are analyzed for seven convective rainfall events that triggered 117 debris flows in the Upper Adige river basin (Eastern Italian Alps). Four radar rainfall scenarios characterized by incrementally increasing accuracy are used for the estimation of rainfall intensity-duration thresholds. Error sources considered in the radar correction chain include beam blockage, attenuation and vertical profile of reflectivity. The impact of rainfall accuracy on the estimation of the intensity-duration thresholds is analyzed by comparing the thresholds derived from the various radar rainfall scenarios, using the rainfall estimates obtained from the application of the complete correction algorithm as a reference scenario. Results show that the application of the complete correction algorithm improves significantly the accuracy of radar rainfall estimates: Fractional Standard Error is decreased by 20{\%}, Correlation Coefficient is increased by 24{\%} relative to uncorrected data. Correction for atmospheric attenuation is the most important step in the correction chain. The use of uncorrected radar estimates leads to substantially underestimated thresholds with respect to the reference scenario; adjusting radar data for bias is not sufficient to overcome this problem. Radar rainfall estimates which are corrected but not adjusted with raingauge data are able to provide intensity-duration thresholds which are almost indistinguishable from the reference scenario. The derivation of the radar-based threshold is shown to be very sensitive to spatial location errors of rainfall and debris flows. Raingauge-based thresholds are severely underestimated with respect to the reference scenario. This clearly demonstrates the severity of the raingauge-based estimation problem for the derivation of debris flow triggering rainfall and highlights the benefits of using weather radar observations, at least for the case of short duration convective storms.},

abstract = {Rainfall stations with a certain number and spatial distribution supply sampling records of rainfall processes in a river basin. Uncertainty may be introduced when the station records are spatially interpolated for the purpose of hydrological 10 simulations. This study adopts a bootstrap method to quantitatively estimate the uncertainty of areal rainfall estimates and its effects on hydrological simulations. The observed rainfall records are first analysed using clustering and correlation methods, and possible average basin rainfall amounts are calculated with a bootstrap method using various combinations of rainfall station subsets. Then, the uncertainty of simulated runoff, which is propagated through a hydrological model from the spatial uncertainty of rainfall estimates, is analysed with the bootstrapped rainfall inputs. By comparing the uncertainties of rainfall 15 and runoff, the responses of the hydrological simulation to the spatial uncertainty of rainfall are discussed. Analyses are performed for three rainfall events in the upstream of the Qingjian River basin, a sub-basin of the Yellow River. Using the Digital Yellow River Integrated Model, the results show that the uncertainty of rainfall estimates derived from rainfall station network has a direct influence on simulated runoff processes. This quantified relationship between rainfall input and simulation performance can provide useful information on managing rainfall station density in river basins. The proposed 20 method could be a guide to quantify an approximate range of simulated error caused by the spatial uncertainty of rainfall input.},

The results show that all the remote-sensing products underestimate the rainfall as compared to the rain gauge measurements, in an order of radar (-18{\%}), 3B42RT (-19{\%}), PERSIANN-CCS (28{\%}), 3B42V6 (-36{\%}), and CMORPH (-61{\%}). The ground radar estimates are also most correlated with gauge measurements, having a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.81 (0.82) at 0.04° (0.25°) spatial resolution. For satellite products, CMORPH has the best spatial correlation (0.70) but largely underestimates the total rainfall accumulation. Compared to microwave ingested algorithms, the IR-dominant algorithms provide a better estimation of the total rainfall accumulation but poorly resolve the temporal evolution of the warm cloud typhoon, especially for a large overestimation at the early storm stage. This study suggests that the best performance comes from the ground radar estimates that could be used as an alternative in case of the gauge denial.

abstract = {Using the same data set as in Part I of this series (obtained from a dense rain gauge network operating with 15 s sampling over the period September 1991 to December 1993), the rainfall climatology of Norfolk Island is examined in terms of the relationship between rainfall accumulations R and fractional time raining (FTR) F. In addition, linear, cubic and power-law fits to the relationship are used as estimators and compared with actual monthly mean rainfall totals at integrations of 1 h, 1 day and 1 month. Cumulative errors in estimated island mean rainfall are compared as a function of both the monthly march and as a function of increasing F. It is shown that F may be used successfully to provide estimates of rainfall accumulation even at the shortest integration time (when the R-F relationship is non-linear) by way of the cubic fit. Temporal variations in the fitting parameters are found to be similar at each gauge site and spatial differences in fitting parameters between sites are systematic. On a year-by-year basis, the mean rainfall per FTR was found to decrease at all sites. A high correlation between the two parameters of the power-law fitting method enables R and F to be related using a single-parameter, though estimates are generally inferior to the linear or cubic fit. Using integration times of 12, 24, 48 and 96 h, the data set was sampled at intervals between 15 s (the present gauge array resolution) and 1800 s (a typical remote sensing resolution) providing R-F correlation trends and mean rainfall per unit F.

abstract = {Ground-based precipitation data are still the dominant input type for hydrological models. Spatial variability in precipitation can be represented by spatially interpolating gauge data using various techniques. In this study, the effect of daily precipitation interpolation methods on discharge simulations using the semi-distributed SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model over a 30-year period is examined. The study was carried out in 11 meso-scale (119–3935 km2) sub-catchments lying in the Sulej{\'{o}}w reservoir catchment in central Poland. Four methods were tested: the default SWAT method (Def) based on the Nearest Neighbour technique, Thiessen Polygons (TP), Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK). =The evaluation of methods was performed using a semi-automated calibration program SUFI-2 (Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Procedure Version 2) with two objective functions: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the adjusted R2 coefficient (bR2). The results show that: (1) the most complex OK method outperformed other methods in terms of NSE; and (2) OK, IDW, and TP outperformed Def in terms of bR2. The median difference in daily/monthly NSE between OK and Def/TP/IDW calculated across all catchments ranged between 0.05 and 0.15, while the median difference between TP/IDW/OK and Def ranged between 0.05 and 0.07. The differences between pairs of interpolation methods were, however, spatially variable and a part of this variability was attributed to catchment properties: catchments characterised by low station density and low coefficient of variation of daily flows experienced more pronounced improvement resulting from using interpolation methods. Methods providing higher precipitation estimates often resulted in a better model performance. The implication from this study is that appropriate consideration of spatial precipitation variability (often neglected by model users) that can be achieved using relatively simple interpolation methods can significantly improve the reliability of model simulations.},

abstract = {Hazard assessment of shallow landslides repre-sents an important aspect of land management in mountain-ous areas. Among all the methods proposed in the literature, physically based methods are the only ones that explicitly in-cludes the dynamic factors that control landslide triggering (rainfall pattern, land-use). For this reason, they allow fore-casting both the temporal and the spatial distribution of shal-low landslides. Physically based methods for shallow land-slides are based on the coupling of the infinite slope stabil-ity analysis with hydrological models. Three different grid-based distributed hydrological models are presented in this paper: a steady state model, a transient " piston-flow " wetting front model, and a transient diffusive model. A comparative test of these models was performed to simulate landslide oc-curred during a rainfall event (27–28 June 1997) that trig-gered hundreds of shallow landslides within Lecco province (central Southern Alps, Italy). In order to test the potential for a completely distributed model for rainfall-triggered land-slides, radar detected rainfall intensity has been used. A new procedure for quantitative evaluation of distributed model performance is presented and used in this paper. The dif-fusive model results in the best model for the simulation of shallow landslide triggering after a rainfall event like the one that we have analysed. Finally, radar data available for the June 1997 event permitted greatly improving the simulation. In particular, radar data allowed to explain the non-uniform distribution of landslides within the study area.},

abstract = {Radar precipitation estimates can improve hydrologic prediction over a range of spatial scales represented by both rural and urban basins. Flooding results from the combination of heavy precipitation and the distributed hydraulic and hydrologic characteristics of the basin. Accuracy and spatial scaling of radar estimated rainfall, and its impact at relevant hydrologic scales is an important determinant of hydrologic prediction accuracy and flood forecasting. Results of simulations using archival radar events are used to demonstrate the sources of uncertainty affecting site-specific flood forecasts within the distributed hydrologic model, Vflo. Radar data used in this analysis are derived from both S-band (NEXRAD/88D) and the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA), polarimetric X-band radars. X-band radars have the capability to provide higher spatial and temporal resolution than the conventional radars operating at S-band. However, compared to S-band, X-band radars have shorter wavelengths and suffer from attenuation, or even total extinction of the radar signal at short ranges from the radar. Degradation of precipitation mapping is a serious concern, especially in heavy precipitation over distances associated with watersheds prone to flooding. Compared to rain gauge accumulations, X-band radar polarimetric rainfall estimates were significantly degraded beyond about 15km from the radars. With rainfall input derived from X-band radars, uncertainty in runoff volume scales with watershed area as a smooth monotonically decreasing function as area increases due to averaging of random errors in the input. Relative to estimates derived from S-band radar, unreliable hydrograph response was produced using X-band polarimetric rainfall estimates as input to a physics-based distributed hydrologic model, especially for watershed areas less than about 20km2. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study explores rainfall spatial variability and its influence on runoff modelling. A novel assess-ment scheme integrated with coefficient of variance and Moran's I is introduced to describe effective rainfall spatial variability. Coefficient of variance is widely accepted to identify rainfall variability through rainfall intensity, whereas Moran's I reflects rainfall spatial autocorrelation. This new assessment framework combines these two indicators to assess the spatial variability derived from both rainfall intensity and distribution, which are crucial in determining the time and magnitude of runoff generation. Four model structures embedded in the Variable Infiltration Capacity model are adopted for hydrological modelling in the Brue catchment of England. The models are assigned with 1, 3, 8, and 27 hydrological response units, respectively, and diverse rainfall spatial information for 236 events are extracted from 1995. This study investigates the model performance of different partitioning based on rainfall spatial variability through peak vol-ume (Q p) and time to peak (T p), along with the rainfall event process. The results show that models associated with dense spatial partitioning are broadly capable of capturing more spatial information with better performance. It is unnecessary to utilize models with high spatial density for simple rainfall events, though they show distinct advantages on complex events. With addi-tional spatial information, Q p experiences a notable improvement over T p . Moreover, seasonal patterns signified by the assessment scheme imply the feasibility of seasonal models.},

abstract = {Due to the inherent indirect nature of radar-rainfall measurements, hydrologists have been interested in understanding the characteristics of radar-rainfall estimation errors and how they propagate through hydrological simulations. This study implements an observation-based empirical approach to analyse different characteristics of the total radar-rainfall estimation error such as overall and conditional bias, random error and spatio-temporal dependence. The implications of the radar error characteristics for streamflow simulations and the estimation of their uncertainty are examined using a physically-based distributed rainfall-runoff model. An empirical error model is used to generate several realizations of probable surface rainfall fields that reflect the identified characteristics of the radar error. These realizations are used to generate ensemble of streamflow predictions. The main conclusions are that: (a) radar errors have complex spatio-temporal characteristics that exhibit significant sampling and natural variations; (b) adjustment of overall and conditional radar biases results in the most significant improvements in runoff predictions; (c) radar random errors have non-negligible correlations both in time and space; and (d) the simulated runoff hydrographs are sensitive to the assumed degree of correlation in the radar errors fields. This study is an initial step toward developing more rigorous approaches for accounting for the effects of radar error on hydrological predictions. Copyright 2008 IAHS Press.},

As test statistics we use the low-order moments of the amplitude distribution, the distribution of generalized fractal dimensions, the generalized scaling exponents, the slope of the power spectrum, and the properties of the spatial autocorrelation. The results of the analysis indicate that all models provide, on average, a satisfactory representation of the statistical properties of the GATE rainfall fields (including the anomalous scaling behavior), with a slightly better performance of the model based on individual rainfall cells. All models, however, display large scatter in the field-to-field comparison with the data.

Precipitation measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution are, in general, desired for urban drainage applications. An advection-based interpolation method is developed which uses methods for vector field estimation already known from short-term weather radar nowcasting. However, instead of forecasting the weather radar rainfall, the proposed interpolation method exploits the advection of the rainfall in the interpolation. The interpolated rainfall fields are validated by measurements at ground level from laser disdrometers. The proposed interpolation method performs better when compared to traditional interpolation of weather radar rainfall where the radar observation is considered constant in time between measurements. It is demonstrated that the advection-based interpolation method reconstructs a significant part of the temporal variations of the rainfall. Moreover, the interpolated precipitation fields estimate accumulated rain depths more accurately. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The forecast of debris flow occurrence relies mainly on empirical rainfall intensity-duration thresholds, which are based on rain gauge observations. This work focuses on the effect of rainfall estimation uncertainty on the estimation of debris flow triggering rainfall events and on the identification of rainfall thresholds for debris flow occurrence. Specifically, the influence of rain gauge network density and the interpolation method on the estimation of debris flow triggering rainfall is investigated. These questions are examined using high-resolution, carefully corrected radar data to represent space-time patterns of true precipitation at the debris flow initiation points and in the surrounding area. Radar rainfall fields are sampled by simulated rain gauge networks, stochastically generated with varying rain gauge densities. Based on these networks, rainfall is estimated by using three rainfall interpolation methods: nearest neighbor (NN), inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK). Results show that NN provides the estimates with bias smaller than IDW and OK but larger estimation variance. Overall, decrease in gauge density leads to increased underestimation and increased estimation variance of debris flow triggering rainfall. Rainfall estimation error leads to large underestimation of the intensity-duration thresholds. However, comparison of results shows that no particular benefit in intensity-duration threshold estimation is obtained by using approaches that are more complex than the NN method.},

abstract = {Heavy rainstorms often induce flash flooding, one of the natural disasters most responsible for damage to man-made infrastructure and loss of lives, adversely affecting also the opportunities for socio-economic development of Mediterranean Countries. The frequently dramatic damage of flash floods are often detected with sufficient accuracy by post-event surveys, but rainfall causing them are still only roughly characterized. With the aim of improving the understanding of the temporal structure and spatial distribution of heavy rainstorms in the Mediterranean context, a statistical analysis was carried out in Calabria (southern Italy) concerning rainstorms that mainly induced flash floods, but also shallow landslides and debris-flows. Thus a method is proposed – based on the overcoming of heuristically predetermined threshold values of cumulated rainfall, maximum intensity, and kinetic energy of the rainfall event – to select and characterize the rainstorms able to induce flash floods in the Mediterranean-climate Countries. Therefore the obtained (heavy) rainstorms were automatically classified and studied according to their structure in time, localization and extension. Rainfall-runoff watershed models can consequently benefit from the enhanced identification of design storms, with a realistic time structure integrated with the results of the spatial analysis. A survey of flash flood events recorded in the last decades provides a preliminary validation of the method proposed to identify the heavy rainstorms and synthetically describe their characteristics. The notable size of the employed sample, including data with a very detailed resolution in time, that relate to several rain gauges well-distributed throughout the region, give robustness to the obtained results.},

In this study, they present the central element of this methodology: an empirically based error structure model for the RR products. The authors apply a product-error-driven (PED) approach to obtain a realistic uncertainty model. It is based on the analyses of six years of data from the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, WSR-88D radar (KTLX) processed with the Precipitation Processing System algorithm of the NEXRAD system. The modeled functional-statistical relationship between RR estimates and corresponding true rainfall consists of two components: a systematic distortion function and a stochastic factor quantifying remaining random errors. The two components are identified using a nonparametric functional estimation apparatus. The true rainfall is approximated with rain gauge data from the Oklahoma Mesonet and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service Micronet networks. The RR uncertainty model presented here accounts for different time scales, synoptic regimes, and distances from the radar. In addition, this study marks the first time in which results on RR error correlation in space and time are presented.},

abstract = {The availability of good and reliable rainfall data is fundamental for most hydrological analyses and for the design and management of water resources systems. However, in practice, precipitation records often suffer from missing data values mainly due to malfunctioning of raingauge for specific time periods. This is an important issue in practical hydrology because it affects the continuity of rainfall data and ultimately influences the results of hydrologic studies which use rainfall as input. Many methods to estimate missing rainfall data have been proposed in literature and, among these, most are based on spatial interpolation algorithms. In this paper different spatial interpolation algorithms have been evaluated to produce a reasonably good continuous dataset bridging the gaps in the historical series. The algorithms used are deterministic methods such as inverse distance weighting, simple linear regression, multiple regression, geographically weighted regression and artificial neural networks, and geostatistical models such as ordinary kriging and residual ordinary kriging. In some of these methods, the elevation information, provided by a Digital Elevation Model, has been added to improve estimation of missing data. These algorithms have been applied to the mean annual and monthly rainfall data of Sicily (Italy), measured at 247 raingauges. Optimization of different settings of the various interpolation methods has been carried out using a subset of the available rainfall dataset (modeling set) while the remaining subset (validation set) has been used to compare the results obtained by the different algorithms. Validation results indicate that the univariate methods, neglecting the information of elevation, are characterized by the largest errors, which decrease when the elevation is taken into account. The ordinary kriging of residuals from linear regression between precipitation and elevation, which has provided the best performance at annual and monthly scale, has been used to complete the precipitation monthly time series in Sicily. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Important climate changes are today observed around the world, frequently yielding destructing precipitations. To identify and follow the evolution of storms in real-time, meteorological radar images collected in Setif (Algeria), Bordeaux (France), and Dakar (Senegal), are processed. Template and pattern recognition-based filters are firstly used to remove the ground clutter and keep the precipitation echoes unchanged. Bidimensional FFT is then applied to the filtered images, showing that the Fourier spectra characterising convective clouds differ significantly from those of stratified ones. This difference can be usefully employed by the radar operators to quickly detect the formation of violent storms. To forecast the growing of rainfall clouds and their motion, the related radar echoes are reconstituted using inverse FFT. It is found that the 26 first harmonics are sufficient to both rapidly and accurately reconstitute the surface of clouds whereas 82 distinct harmonics are needed to well reproduce their reflectivity. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Starting about thirty years ago, new ideas in nonlinear dynamics, particularly fractals and scaling, provoked an explosive growth of research both in modeling and in experimentally characterizing geosystems over wide ranges of scale. In this review we focus on scaling advances in solid earth geophysics including the topography. To reduce the review to manageable proportions, we restrict our attention to scaling fields, i.e. to the discussion of intensive quantities such as ore concentrations, rock densities, susceptibilities, and magnetic and gravitational fields. We discuss the growing body of evidence showing that geofields are scaling (have power law dependencies on spatial scale, resolution), over wide ranges of both horizontal and vertical scale. Focusing on the cases where both horizontal and vertical statistics have both been estimated from proximate data, we argue that the exponents are systematically different, reflecting lithospheric stratification which while very strong at small scales - becomes less and less pronounced at larger and larger scales, but in a scaling manner. We then discuss the necessity for treating the fields as multifractals rather than monofractals, the latter being too restrictive a framework. We discuss the consequences of multifractality for geostatistics, we then discuss cascade processes in which the same dynamical mechanism repeats scale after scale over a range. Using the binomial model first proposed by de Wijs (1951) as an example, we discuss the issues of microcanonical versus canonical conservation, algebraic ("Pareto") versus long tailed (e.g. lognormal) distributions, multifractal universality, conservative and nonconservative multifractal processes, codimension versus dimension formalisms. We compare and contrast different scaling models (fractional Brownian motion, fractional Levy motion, continuous (in scale) cascades), showing that they are all based on fractional integrations of noises built up from singularity basis functions. We show how anisotropic (including stratified) models can be produced simply by replacing the usual distance function by an anisotropic scale function, hence by replacing isotropic singularities by anisotropic ones.},

Solar energy is the feedstock/source for various applications of RES, and thus, the knowledge of the intensity of the incident solar irradiance is essential for monitoring the performance of such systems. A lot of experimental work and modeling has already been conducted for calculating solar irradiance due to various factors, such as location and season. The major unpredictable factor in defining the solar irradiance and the performance of solar systems is the presence of clouds in the sky. So far, various researchers proposed several models for estimating solar irradiance in correlation with cloud coverage and cloud type. This paper reviews the up-to-date research in automatic cloud detection and classification. It initiates with a brief introduction to clouds types and classification. Then, a detailed description of the equipment used for the measurements is provided, either ground based or satellite integrated.

The data were analyzed both separated into groups depending on the rainfall generating mechanism (warm fronts, cold fronts, and convection, respectively) and pooled into one group representing the total rainfall process in the area. The results indicated that the daily spatial rainfall distributions were well characterized by a multifractal behavior both separated into mechanism groups and pooled into one group. The multifractal properties, however, displayed distinct differences which were related to physical differences of the rainfall generating mechanisms. The multifractal properties of the total rainfall process agreed well with the properties of the cold front group. Investigations of interpolated grids showed that these well preserve the multifractal behavior of the original data, but modify the multifractal properties.},

abstract = {Early detection of possible occurrences of severe convective events would be useful in order to avoid, or at least mitigate, the environmental and socio-economic damages caused by such events. However, the enormous volume of meteorological data currently available makes difficult, if not impossible, its analysis by meteorologists. In addition, severe convective events may occur in very different spatial and temporal scales, precluding their early and accurate prediction. In this work, we propose an innovative approach for the classification of meteorological data based on the frequency of occurrence of the values of different variables provided by a weather forecast model. It is possible to identify patterns that may be associated to severe convective activity. In the considered classification problem, the information attributes are variables outputted by the weather forecast model Eta, while the decision attribute is given by the density of occurrence of cloud-to-ground atmospheric electrical discharges, assumed as correlated to the level of convective activity. Results show good classification performance for some selected mini-regions of Brazil during the summer of 2007. We expect that the screening of the outputs of the meteorological model Eta by the proposed classifier could serve as a support tool for meteorologists in order to identify in advance patterns associated to severe convective events.},

This study presents a long-term and high-resolution investigation of soil moisture, surface and subsurface flow using three large-scale lysimeters on a slope with 23.5?? inclination on a landfill site in Karlsruhe, Germany. Data from a 10-year observation period were evaluated for this study, including weekly soil moisture data obtained by neutron probes, continuous discharge data from the land surface and several layers within the soil zone, and hydrometeorological data from a climate station. The results reveal (i) clear temporal and spatial patterns of soil moisture variations down to a depth of 250. cm, (ii) substantially higher discharge and faster percolation rates in the lower part of the lysimeter field, indicating significant downhill flow at various depths within the soil profile, (iii) characteristic threshold values for flow processes in the soil, associated with a hysteresis effect between soil moisture and flow processes. These results can be used as a basis of improved numerical models for the simulation of floods, soil moisture distributions, and vegetation patterns.},

To understand these interactions in relation to climate, landform, geology, and biotic factors, a sound hydrogeoecological framework is needed. All these aspects are synthesized and exemplified in this overview. In addition, the mechanisms of interactions between groundwater and surface water (GW–SW) as they affect recharge–discharge processes are comprehensively outlined, and the ecological significance and the human impacts of such interactions are emphasized. Surface-water and groundwater ecosystems are viewed as linked components of a hydrologic continuum leading to related sustainability issues. This overview concludes with a discussion of research needs and challenges facing this evolving field. The biogeochemical processes within the upper few centimeters of sediments beneath nearly all surface-water bodies (hyporheic zone) have a profound effect on the chemistry of the water interchange, and here is where most of the recent research has been focusing. However, to advance conceptual and other modeling of GW–SW systems, a broader perspective of such interactions across and between surface-water bodies is needed, including multidimensional analyses, interface hydraulic characterization and spatial variability, site-to-region regionalization approaches, as well as cross-disciplinary collaborations.},

abstract = {A grid-based flow routing and runoff-production model, configured to employ as input either observed or Regional Climate Model (RCM) estimates of precipitation and potential evaporation (PE), has previously been used to assess how climate change may impact river flows across the UK. The slope-based Grid-to-Grid (G2G) model adequately simulated observed river flows under current climate conditions for high relief catchments, but was less successful when applied to lower-relief and/or groundwater-dominated areas. The model has now been enhanced to employ a soil dataset to configure the probability-distributed store controlling soil-moisture and runoff generation within each grid-cell. A comparison is made of the ability of both models to simulate gauged river flows across a range of British catchments using observations of rainfall and PE as input. Superior performance from the enhanced G2G formulation incorporating the soil dataset is demonstrated. Following the model assessment, the observed precipitation and PE data used as input to both hydrological models were replaced by RCM estimates on a 25 km grid for a Current (1961-1990) and a Future (2071-2100) time-slice. Flood frequency curves derived from the flow simulations for the two time-slices are used to estimate, for the first time, maps of changes in flood magnitude for all river points on a 1 km grid across the UK. A high degree of spatial variability is seen in the estimated change in river flows, reflecting both projected climate change and the influences of landscape and climate variability. These maps also highlight large differences between the climate impact projections arising from the two models. The improved structure and performance of the soil-based G2G model adds confidence to its projections of flow changes being realistic consequences of the climate change scenario applied. A resampling method is used to identify regions where these projections may be considered robust. However, with the climate change scenario used representing only one plausible evolution of the future climate, no clear message can be drawn here about projected river flow changes.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The study of single streamflow recession events is receiving increasing attention following the presentation of novel theoretical explanations for the emergence of power-law forms of the recession relationship, and drivers of its variability. Individually characterizing streamflow recessions often involves describing the similarities and differences between model parameters fitted to each recession time series. Significant methodological sensitivity has been identified in the fitting and parameterization of models that describe populations of many recessions, but the dependence of estimated model parameters on methodological choices has not been evaluated for event-by-event forms of analysis. Here, we use daily streamflow data from 16 catchments in northern California and southern Oregon to investigate how combinations of commonly used streamflow recession definitions and fitting techniques impact parameter estimates of a widely-used power-law recession model. We show that: (i) methodological decisions, including ones that have received little attention in the literature, can impact parameter value estimates and model goodness-of-fit; (ii) the central tendencies of event-scale recession parameter probability distributions are largely robust to methodological choices, in the sense that differing methods rank catchments similarly according to the medians of these distributions; (iii) recession parameter distributions are method-dependent, but roughly catchment-independent, such that changing the choices made about a particular method affects a given parameter in similar ways across most catchments; and (iv) the observed correlative relationship between the power law recession scale parameter and catchment antecedent wetness varies depending on recession definition and fitting choices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rapid subsurface flow in structured soils facilitates fast vertical and lateral redistribution of event water. Despite their significance and omnipresence the related processes are challenging hydrological exploration, monitoring, modeling and theory. One reason for this is that flow processes at high velocities are difficult to observe in the subsurface. Another reason is that advective flow is channeled in distinct connected structures several orders of magnitude smaller than commonly resolved observation volumes. This is the second part of a companion paper with a focus on $\backslash$textit{\{}in situ{\}} experimental exploration of rapid subsurface flow. Complementary to the temporal dynamics, this study looks into the identification of spatially organized structures. We present a bottom-up approach with point-scale measurements, plot-scale multi-tracer experiments and a hillslope-scale irrigation experiment. Special emphasis is given to the employed 2D and 3D time-lapse ground penetrating radar monitoring under field conditions on forested, young soils on periglacial slope deposits. The study highlights the difficulty to draw conclusions beyond overall heterogeneity from point observations in a basically unknown and structured domain. We also spotlight the challenge to identify relevant structures based on a single quasi-static exploration. A coherent combination of different hydrological and geophysical methods to monitor the system under driven conditions was key to reduce ambiguity in the identification of hydrologically relevant structures and the overall process understanding.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Scales of soil moisture variations are important for understanding patterns of climate change, for developing and evaluating land surface models, for designing surface soil moisture observation networks, and for determining the appropriate resolution for satellite-based remote sensing instruments for soil moisture. Here we take advantage of a new archive of in situ soil moisture observations from Illinois and Iowa in the United States, and from Russia, Mongolia, and China, to evaluate the observed temporal and spatial scales of soil moisture variations. We separate the variance into two components, the very small scale, determined by soils, topography, vegetation, and root structure, and the large scale forced by the atmosphere. This larger scale, determined by precipitation and evaporation patterns, is of interest for global climate modeling. We characterize the small scale as white noise for our analysis, keeping in mind that it is an important component of soil moisture variations for other problems. We find that the atmospheric spatial scale for all regions is about 500 km. The atmospheric temporal scale is about 2 months for the top 1-m soil layer. The temporal scale for the top 10-cm layer is slightly less than 2 months. The white noise component of the variance for temporal variations ranges from 50{\%} for the top 10 cm to 20–40{\%} for the top 1 m. For spatial variations the white noise component is the same for all depths but varies with region from 30{\%} for Illinois to around 70{\%} for Mongolia. Nevertheless, the red noise (atmospheric component) can be seen in all regions. These results are for Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes and would not necessarily apply to other latitudes. The results are based on observations taken from grassland or agricultural areas, and may not be similar to those of areas with other vegetation types. In China, a region with substantial latitudinal variation, the temporal scale for the top 1 m varies from 1 month in the south to 2.5 months in the north, demonstrating the control of potential evaporation on the temporal scales. Seasonal analysis of the scales of soil moisture for Illinois shows that during the winter the temporal scales are long, though the spatial scales are short. We suggest that these variations are both attributable to the seasonal cycle of potential evaporation.},

abstract = {Baseflow separation methods are often impractical, require expensive materials and time-consuming methods, and/or are not designed for individual events in small watersheds. To provide a simple baseflow separation method for small watersheds, we describe a new precipitation-based technique known as the Sliding Average with Rain Record (SARR). The SARR uses rainfall data to justify each separation of the hydrograph. SARR has several advantages such as: it shows better consistency with the precipitation and discharge records, it is easier and more practical to implement, and it includes a method of event identification based on precipitation and quickflow response. SARR was derived from the United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH) method with several key modifications to adapt it for small watersheds ({\textless}50km 2). We tested SARR on watersheds in the Choptank Basin on the Delmarva Peninsula (US Mid-Atlantic region) and compared the results with the UKIH method at the annual scale and the hydrochemical method at the individual event scale. Annually, SARR calculated a baseflow index that was ???10{\%} higher than the UKIH method due to the finer time step of SARR (1 d) compared to UKIH (5 d). At the watershed scale, hydric soils were an important driver of the annual baseflow index likely due to increased groundwater retention in hydric areas. At the event scale, SARR calculated less baseflow than the hydrochemical method, again because of the differences in time step (hourly for hydrochemical) and different definitions of baseflow. Both SARR and hydrochemical baseflow increased with event size, suggesting that baseflow contributions are more important during larger storms. To make SARR easy to implement, we have written a MatLab program to automate the calculations which requires only daily rainfall and daily flow data as inputs. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The surface or near-surface soil moisture at the interface between atmospheric and terrestrial environments has significant implications for the complex interactions between hydrological processes and ecosystems. Although a number of previous studies have reported the spatial patterns and structures of surface moisture in pasture environments based on large sample sizes, information regarding the detailed spatial patterns and structure of surface moisture in a natural forest environment is still sparse, particularly for steep headwater catchments due to the labor intensity involved and the difficulty of making field measurements. In this study, we measured the detailed surface soil water content at depths of 0-12cm and 0-20cm at 470 measurement points using the TDR (time domain reflectometry) method. Thirteen surveys were conducted within 1year in a steep natural forested headwater catchment with a subtropical monsoon climate in Taiwan. The sample and model variograms were used to evaluate the spatial structure of the surface soil moisture. We also compared the spatial structures of surface moisture in this study with those in a similar study conducted in a flat pasture catchment (Western et al., 1998). For the results at our site, exponential model variograms with the nugget effect well fitted sample variograms, indicating an obvious regional dependence of surface moisture and stationary spatial structures in all surveys. The geostatistical structural characteristics of the nugget varied between 22.70 and 47.40 ({\%} V/V)2; the sill varied between 54.99 and 98.51 ({\%} V/V)2; and the range varied between 10.20 and 58.65m. The nugget, sill, and range all increased with an increase in soil moisture. The notable anisotropy under dry conditions was attributed to the year-round surface runoff pathway. The sample variograms that represented the spatial structure of soil moisture and reliably estimated the nugget, sill, and range required a sample size of at least 235 at our 0.15-ha site (i.e., a measurement resolution of at least 6.4m2 per sample). The pattern of soil moisture was relatively stationary in two gullies and on the side of a hillslope, but it varied on the valley-head hillslope depending on whether conditions were dry or wet. In contrast to previous results for a flat pasture catchment (Western et al., 1998), our results produced a right-skewed histogram of soil moisture under dry or moderately wet conditions, variograms that tended to increase with an increase in soil moisture, anisotropy of soil moisture structure under dry, but not wet, conditions, a need for a 55 times higher measurement resolution associated with the large sample size, and a larger nugget effect in the steep natural forested headwater catchment. This study identified the spatial structure and patterns of surface soil moisture as the primary step in understanding hydrologic processes in a natural forested headwater catchment.},

abstract = {Understanding how watershed characteristics and climate influence the baseflow component of stream discharge is a topic of interest to both the scientific and water management communities. Therefore, the development of baseflow estimation methods is a topic of active research. Previous studies have demonstrated that graphical hydrograph separation (GHS) and conductivity mass balance (CMB) methods can be applied to stream discharge data to estimate daily baseflow. While CMB is generally considered to be a more objective approach than GHS, its application across broad spatial scales is limited by a lack of high frequency specific conductance (SC) data. We propose a new method that uses discrete SC data, which are widely available, to estimate baseflow at a daily time step using the CMB method. The proposed approach involves the development of regression models that relate discrete SC concentrations to stream discharge and time. Regression-derived CMB baseflow estimates were more similar to baseflow estimates obtained using a CMB approach with measured high frequency SC data than were the GHS baseflow estimates at twelve snowmelt dominated streams and rivers. There was a near perfect fit between the regression-derived and measured CMB baseflow estimates at sites where the regression models were able to accurately predict daily SC concentrations. We propose that the regression-derived approach could be applied to estimate baseflow at large numbers of sites, thereby enabling future investigations of watershed and climatic characteristics that influence the baseflow component of stream discharge across large spatial scales.},

abstract = {The simple dynamical system approach was implemented to analyze, explain and simulate streamflow fluxes in diverse seasonal hydrological conditions within the forested Pade{\v{z}} stream catchment in SW Slovenia. The catchment is characterized by the flushing, torrential hydrological response conditioned by the flysch geological settings of a low hydraulic conductivity. Consequently, the streamflow formation is not controlled solely by the deeper subsurface catchment storage but is also strongly influenced by the rainfall–runoff that bypasses the deeper subsurface part of the total catchment storage. Therefore, fast component of the streamflow is identified using two-component hydrograph separation; the component recession behavior is described by a separate sensitivity function and used in a simple model to simulate the streamflow. According to the simulation results, the Pade{\v{z}} stream catchment behaves primarily like a deeper subsurface storage-dependent system during most of the hydrological conditions. When rainfall intensities increase (rainfall intensities close to 10mm/h or higher), triggering of the secondary streamflow formation mechanism described by separate, bypassing flow sensitivity function becomes evident and causes fast hydrograph formation with steeply rising and falling limbs. To be able to implement the modeling concept for streamflow predictions, the rainfall losses, most likely associated with interception losses not covered under the potential evapotranspiration calculation, would have to be more thoroughly analyzed through rainfall interception measurements. Our study shows the possible way that two hydrological concepts, the streamflow recession analysis and the two-component hydrograph separation based on relatively easily measurable tracers, such as electrical conductivity, could be combined for analyzing streamflow fluxes.},

abstract = {To examine stream recession rates, hydrologists have plotted the rate of change in discharge (dQ/dt) versus the mean discharge (Q). Such plots typically result in a large cloud of data points where the slope of the lower bound of the cloud is often used to infer aquifer hydraulic properties as informed by certain interpretations of the Boussinesq Equation. For seven watersheds in New York State, USA ranging from 100km 2 to 6415km 2, we distinguish data points in the dQ/dt-Q plot belonging to individual recession events instead of looking at the entire data cloud. The recession curve of individual events consistently shifts upward during the summer and late fall (relative to spring and late fall curves) and much of the scatter in the data cloud appears to be due to seasonal variations in recession. We speculate that these seasonal variations in recession rate may be due to variations in watershed evapotranspiration (ET). Additionally, most individual recession events have slopes of approximately two when plotted as log dQ/dt versus logQ. Application of the Boussinesq Equation to watershed-scale recession date predicts slopes shifting from 3 to 3/2 as recession progresses, thus the observed slope of two casts doubt on whether it is appropriate to apply hydraulic aquifer theory to these types of watersheds to infer aquifer properties or predict low flows. As a further validation of the hydrologic information content of individual recession curves, the individual recession curves from time periods with minimal ET (early spring and late fall) were used to establish storage-discharge functions for two of the smaller watersheds. With these storage-discharge functions, a simple hydrologic model could reasonably simulate time series with minimal calibration (Nash-Sutcliffe R 2 of 0.71 and 0.67 on log transformed discharge). Overall, this paper suggests that the analysis of individual event recession curves (particularly when compared among watersheds and seasons) can be a valuable tool for gaining insights into hydrological processes at the scale of large watersheds and can justify alternatives to current low flow models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

                        2), which is the size needed for some hydrological applications and for remote sensing validation analysis, is done. Specifically, measurements were carried out in two adjacent areas located in central Italy with extension of 178 and 242km 
                        2 and over a period of 1year (35 sampling days) with almost weekly frequency except for the summer period because of soil hardness. For each area, 46 sites were monitored and, for each site, 3 measurements were performed to obtain reliable soil moisture estimates. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 0-15cm. A statistical and temporal stability analysis is employed to assess the space-time variability of soil moisture at local and catchment scale. Moreover, by comparing the results with those obtained in previous studies conducted in the same study area, a synthesis of soil moisture variability for a range of spatial scales, from few square meters to several square kilometers, is attempted. For the investigated area, the two main findings inferred are: (1) the spatial variability of soil moisture increases with the area up to {\~{}}10km 
                        2 and then remains quite constant with an average coefficient of variation equal to {\~{}}0.20; (2) regardless of the areal extension, the soil moisture exhibits temporal stability features and, hence, few measurements can be used to infer areal mean values with a good accuracy (determination coefficient higher than 0.88). These insights based on in situ soil moisture observations corroborate the opportunity to use point information for the validation of coarse resolution satellite images. Moreover, the feasibility to use coarse resolution data for hydrological applications in small to medium sized catchments is confirmed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we present a well-dated, pollen-based, {\~{}}20-yr-resolution quantitative precipitation reconstruction (derived using a transfer function) from an alpine lake in North China, which provides for the first time a direct record of EASM evolution since 14.7 ka (ka = thousands of years before present, where the "present" is defined as the year AD 1950). Our record reveals a gradually intensifying monsoon from 14.7-7.0 ka, a maximum monsoon (30{\%} higher precipitation than present) from {\~{}}7.8-5.3 ka, and a rapid decline since {\~{}}3.3 ka. These insolation-driven EASM trends were punctuated by two millennial-scale weakening events which occurred synchronously to the cold Younger Dryas and at {\~{}}9.5-8.5 ka, and by two centennial-scale intervals of enhanced (weakened) monsoon during the Medieval Warm Period (Little Ice Age). Our precipitation reconstruction, consistent with temperature changes but quite different from the prevailing view of EASM evolution, points to strong internal feedback processes driving the EASM, and may aid our understanding of future monsoon behaviour under ongoing anthropogenic climate change.},

abstract = {The cumulative impacts of urban land use change on natural stream flow regimes and lotic ecosystems are poorly understood, and generally under-studied within the hydrologic sciences literature. Moreover, flow assessments using daily or monthly flows cannot adequately characterize long-term trends in event-scale flow dynamics in urbanizing watersheds. Accordingly, we analyzed high temporal resolution (15-min flows) growing season discharge records for two urbanizing watersheds in Canada's Great Lakes Basin, the Don and Humber, over a 42-year period. Results show that total discharge between May 26th and November 15th in the mainstem rivers has increased by about 45{\%}, independent of total rainfall depth, over four decades. Peak rain event flow rates have increased by almost 0.1m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in both watersheds and event flow variability has increased two-fold in the Don and almost five-fold in the Humber. In the Don, the ratio of rising limb event flows to median flow (for the period May 26 to November 15) increased from 1.5 in the 1970's to 2.3 in the 2000's. A similar comparison of ratios in the Humber showed similar results, with higher variation in flow response Rising limb event flow acceleration increased 2-fold over 4 decades in the Don and slightly more in the Humber. This study provides a new understanding of the changes in event-scale flow regime dynamics associated with over four decades of intensive urbanization, including increased magnitude of rising limb flows and flow acceleration, and systematic increases in the variability of peak discharges. Overall, our analysis demonstrates marked alteration in total and event flow regimes resulting in chronic perturbation of stream flows. The results demonstrate an important application of long-term, high temporal resolution hydrological records. Furthermore, we quantify the degree to which hydrologic stationarity within the Don and Humber watersheds has been compromised over four decades, during a period prior to detectable climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable in hydrological processes. Although the combined effects of multiple climatic factors in different land cover conditions are highly valuable for water resource management, a complete understanding of these effects remains unclear. This study used a cluster analysis approach to investigate the combined effects of precipitation and air temperature, rather than a single factor, in different land covers for an area over the Poyang Lake Basin in China from 2003 to 2009. Specifically, monthly soil moisture was classified into eight clusters according to the change in precipitation and air temperature; the clusters describe a range of climates from the extreme of wet-hot to that of dry-cold. For an individual climate factor, our results showed that the contribution of air temperature to soil moisture is greater than that of precipitation, and the effect of air temperature is more sensitive in different land covers. When considering the combined effects of precipitation and air temperature, soil moisture varies with land cover; however, the variation in a normal climate cluster is greater than in an extreme climate cluster. This indicated that land cover is the dominant factor in soil moisture variation in normal climatic conditions, whereas climate is the dominant factor in extreme conditions. As climate shifts from the wet-hot to the dry-cold cluster, soil moisture decreases for all land covers, with the minimum rate occurring in forest conditions. Meanwhile, soil moisture deficit and saturation are more likely to occur in grassland and forest areas, indicating that forest cover might mitigate drought. The results of this study provide an effective approach to investigate the combined effects of climate factors on soil moisture for various land covers in humid areas. This study also supports the management of water resources in changing climates.},

The resulting equation allows the expression of the month-to-month soil moisture autocorrelation as a function of 1) the initial soil moisture variability, 2) the (atmospheric) forcing variability over the considered time period, 3) the correlation between initial soil moisture and subsequent forcing, 4) the sensitivity of evaporation to soil moisture, and 5) the sensitivity of runoff to soil moisture. A specific new feature is the disentangling of the roles of initial soil moisture variability and forcing variability, which were both (for the latter indirectly) contributing to the seasonality term of the original formulation. In addition, a version of the framework entirely based on explicit equations for the underlying relationships (i.e., independent of soil moisture statistics at the following time step) is proposed. ...},

abstract = {Three-component (throughfall, soil water, groundwater) hydrograph separations at peak flow were performed on 10 storms over a 2-year period in a small forested catchment in north-central Maryland using an iterative and an exact solution. Seven pairs of tracers (deuterium and oxygen 18, deuterium and chloride, deuterium and sodium, deuterium and silica, chloride and silica, chloride and sodium, and sodium and silica) were used for three-component hydrograph separation for each storm at peak flow to determine whether or not the assumptions of hydrograph separation routinely can be met, to assess the adequacy of some commonly used tracers, to identify patterns in hydrograph-separation results, and to develop conceptual models for the patterns observed. Results of the three-component separations were not always physically meaningful, suggesting that assumptions of hydrograph separation had been violated. Uncertainties in solutions to equations for hydrograph separations were large, partly as a result of violations of assumptions used in deriving the separation equations and partly as a result of improper identification of chemical compositions of end-members. Results of three-component separations using commonly used tracers were widely variable. Consistent patterns in the amount of subsurface water contributing to peak flow (45–100{\%}) were observed, no matter which separation method or combination of tracers was used. A general conceptual model for the sequence of contributions from the three end-members could be developed for 9 of the 10 storms. Overall results indicated that hydrochemical and hydrometric measurements need to be coupled in order to perform meaningful hydrograph separations.},

We observed chloride concentrations of up to 25{\%} of the concentration of seawater in streams of Maryland, New York, and New Hampshire during winters, and chloride concentrations remaining up to 100 times greater than unimpacted forest streams during summers. Mean annual chloride concentration increased as a function of impervious surface and exceeded tolerance for freshwater life in suburban and urban watersheds.

This new filter has the inconvenience of having two parameters, one of them may be obtained directly from recession analysis, but the other (maximum baseflow index (BFImax)) is routinely estimated by a priori defined values according to the predominant geological characteristics of the drainage basin. In this short communication, we propose a method to estimate BFImax by a backwards filtering operation. The method was applied using data from 15 gauging stations in Brazil, with a varied range of groundwater contribution to streamflow. Results of the new estimation method for the BFImax parameter are coherent with the values which would be adopted by considering geological characteristics of the river basins.},

abstract = {Base flow is an important component in hydrological modeling. This process is usually modeled by using the linear aquifer storage-discharge relation approach, although the outflow from groundwater aquifers is nonlinear. To identify the accuracy of base flow estimates in rivers dominated by snowmelt and/or glacier melt in arid and cold northwestern China, a nonlinear storage-discharge relationship for use in SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) modeling was developed and applied to the Manas River basin in the Tian Shan Mountains. Linear reservoir models and a digital filter program were used for comparisons. Meanwhile, numerical analysis of recession curves from 78 river gauge stations revealed variation in the parameters of the nonlinear relationship. It was found that the nonlinear reservoir model can improve the streamflow simulation, especially for low-flow period. The higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, logarithmic efficiency, and volumetric efficiency, and lower percent bias were obtained when compared to the one-linear reservoir approach. The parameter {\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}/i{\textgreater} of the aquifer storage-discharge function varied mostly between 0.0 and 0.1, which is much smaller than the suggested value of 0.5.

abstract = {Daily streamflow information is critical for solving various hydrologic problems, though observations of continuous streamflow for model calibration are available at only a small fraction of the world's rivers. One approach to estimate daily streamflow at an ungauged location is to transfer rainfall-runoff model parameters calibrated at a gauged (donor) catchment to an ungauged (receiver) catchment of interest. Central to this approach is the selection of a hydrologically similar donor. No single metric or set of metrics of hydrologic similarity have been demonstrated to consistently select a suitable donor catchment. We design an experiment to diagnose the dominant controls on successful hydrologic model parameter transfer. We calibrate a lumped rainfall-runoff model to 83 stream gauges across the United States. All locations are USGS reference gauges with minimal human influence. Parameter sets from the calibrated models are then transferred to each of the other catchments and the performance of the transferred parameters is assessed. This transfer experiment is carried out both at the scale of the entire US and then for six geographic regions. We use classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to determine the relationship between catchment similarity and performance of transferred parameters. Similarity is defined using physical/climatic catchment characteristics, as well as streamflow response characteristics (signatures such as baseflow index and runoff ratio). Across the entire US, successful parameter transfer is governed by similarity in elevation and climate, and high similarity in streamflow signatures. Controls vary for different geographic regions though. Geology followed by drainage, topography and climate constitute the dominant similarity metrics in forested eastern mountains and plateaus, whereas agricultural land use relates most strongly with successful parameter transfer in the humid plains.},

abstract = {The pattern of streamflow recession after rain events offers clues about the relationship between watershed runoff (observable as river discharge) and water storage (not directly observable) and can help in water resource assessment and prediction. However, there have been few systematic assessments of how streamflow recession varies across flow rates and how it relates to independent assessments of terrestrial water storage. We characterized the streamflow recession pattern in 61 relatively undisturbed small watersheds (1-100 km(2)) across the coterminous United States with multiyear records of hourly streamflow from automated gauges. We used the North American Regional Reanalysis to help identify periods where precipitation, snowmelt, and evaporation were small compared to streamflow. The order of magnitude of the recession timescale increases from 1 day at high flow rates (similar to 1 mm h(-1)) to 10 days at low flow rates (similar to 0.01 mm h(-1)), leveling off at low flow rates. There is significant variability in the recession timescale at a given flow rate between basins, which correlates with climate and geomorphic variables such as the ratio of mean streamflow to precipitation and soil water infiltration capacity. Stepwise multiple regression was used to construct a six-variable predictive model that explained some 80{\%} of the variance in recession timescale at high flow rates and 30-50{\%} at low flow rates. Seasonal and interannual variability in inferred storage shows similar time evolution to regional-scale water storage variability estimated from GRACE satellite gravity data and from land surface modeling forced by observed meteorology, but is up to a factor of 10 smaller. Study of this discrepancy in the inferred storage amplitude may provide clues to the range of validity of the recession curve approach to relating runoff and storage.},

Accordingly, we analyzed individual late-time recession curves from 25 nested USGS stream gauges over a period of {\~{}}150days with negligible precipitation during the 2012-2013 North American drought. These gauges are located in the Iowa and Cedar River basins and drain areas ranging from {\~{}}70 to 17,000km2. Our data analyses show that these late-time recession processes can be represented by a linear reservoir model with a constant recession time scale of about 34days, indicating linear and homogeneous recession behaviors at the large scales investigated. However, others have shown that the early-time recession process becomes more nonlinear as spatial scale and, thus, spatial variability increases. We developed a distributed drainage model as a diagnostic tool to understand these seemingly contradictory recession characteristics at multiple spatial scales and different stages. With a hierarchical description of the recession variability at the hillslope scale, our model can simultaneously produce the increasing nonlinear early-time and the linear and homogenous late-time recession behaviors at larger scales. The hierarchical representation classifies hillslopes according to the Strahler orders of the stream links into which they drain. We postulate that a larger difference in recession behaviors will occur between hillslopes from different orders than between those from the same order. Overall, this study shows how the spatial randomness and nonrandomness of small-scale process variability control the hydrologic responses at larger scales and suggests a combined (nonrandom-random) representation of watersheds for aggregating hydrologic processes.},

abstract = {As a key variable of the land-climate system soil moisture is a main driver of streamflow and evapotranspiration under certain conditions. Soil moisture furthermore exhibits outstanding memory (persistence) characteristics. Many studies also report distinct low frequency variations for streamflow, which are likely related to soil moisture memory. Using data from over 100 near-natural catchments located across Europe, we investigate in this study the connection between soil moisture memory and the respective memory of streamflow and evapotranspiration on different time scales. For this purpose we use a simple water balance model in which dependencies of runoff (normalised by precipitation) and evapotranspiration (normalised by radiation) on soil moisture are fitted using streamflow observations. The model therefore allows us to compute the memory characteristics of soil moisture, streamflow and evapotranspiration on the catchment scale. We find considerable memory in soil moisture and streamflow in many parts of the continent, and evapotranspiration also displays some memory at monthly time scale in some catchments. We show that the memory of streamflow and evapotranspiration jointly depend on soil moisture memory and on the strength of the coupling of streamflow and evapotranspiration to soil moisture. Furthermore, we find that the coupling strengths of streamflow and evapotranspiration to soil moisture depend on the shape of the fitted dependencies and on the variance of the meteorological forcing. To better interpret the magnitude of the respective memories across Europe, we finally provide a new perspective on hydrological memory by relating it to the mean duration required to recover from anomalies exceeding a certain threshold.},

abstract = {The Himalayan region of Nepal and northern India experiences hydrological extremes from monsoonal floods during July to September, when most of the annual precipitation falls, to periods of very low flows during the dry season (December to February). While the monsoon floods cause acute disasters such as loss of human life and property, mudslides and infrastructure damage, the lack of water during the dry season has a chronic impact on the lives of local people. The management of water resources in the region is hampered by relatively sparse hydrometerological networks and consequently, many resource assessments are required in catchments where no measurements exist. A hydrological model for estimating dry season flows in ungauged catchments, based on recession curve behaviour, has been developed to address this problem. Observed flows were fitted to a second order storage model to enable average annual recession behaviour to be examined. Regionalised models were developed, using a calibration set of 26 catchments, to predict three recession curve parameters: the storage constant; the initial recession flow and the start date of the recession. Relationships were identified between: the storage constant and catchment area; the initial recession flow and elevation (acting as a surrogate for rainfall); and the start date of the recession and geographic location. An independent set of 13 catchments was used to evaluate the robustness of the models. The regional models predicted the average volume of water in an annual recession period (1st of October to the 1st of February) with an average error of 8{\%}, while mid-January flows were predicted to within ±50{\%} for 79{\%} of the catchments in the data set.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p style="line-height: 20px;"{\textgreater}{\textless}b{\textgreater}Keywords: {\textless}/b{\textgreater}Himalaya, recession curve, water resources, ungauged catchment, regionalisation, low flows},

abstract = {This paper studies the inter-annual precipitation variations in different regions of East Asia from oceans to interior areas in China during 1979 - 2012. The results computed by Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) demonstrate that the annual precipitation changes are mainly related to the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation, East Asian summer monsoon and aerosols. We also found that the increased Sea surface temperature (SST) could explain the precipitation changes over the Northwest Pacific in the dry season (Oct. - May) and the East China Sea and the South China Sea in the rainy season (Jun. - Sep.). The precipitation changes over the ocean unexplained by SST were likely due to the water vapor transport dominated by dynamic factors. With the increased SST, the moisture transported from oceans to interior land was likely redistributed and caused the complicated regional variability of precipitation. Moreover, the impacts of aerosols on cloud and precipitation varied with different pollution levels and different seasons.},

abstract = {Understanding the pathways by which event water contributes to stream stormflow provides insight into stormflow generation mechanisms. We analyze the impact of storm size on the relative contribution of event water to stormflow by using natural variations in the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation and stream water to separate multiple stormflow hydrographs from a single fourth-order, 1212 ha catchment. We extend previous isotope-based hydrograph separations by independently accounting for the contribution of event water via direct channel precipitation to the stream hydrograph. The direct channel precipitation contribution is determined using a numerical model of stream flow routing though the catchment, taking precipitation and digital elevation data as input variables. For the range of storm sizes sampled, having recurrence intervals ranging from less than a week to ???4 months, essentially all the event water in stream stormflow can be attributed to direct channel precipitation. Event water not directly falling on the stream channel indirectly contributes to stormflow by increasing the subsurface discharge of pre-event water to the stream. Neither the hydrograph separation data, field observations during the precipitation events, nor experimental observations of flow in a large-scale natural soil column extracted from the watershed are consistent with macropore flow or groundwater ridging as the primary mechanism responsible for increasing subsurface discharge. Results from a series of artificial rain experiments using the unsaturated natural soil column are consistent with a preferential kinematic flow model and indicate that the discharge of pre-event water to the stream during a storm event may be controlled by kinematic flow processes within the watershed soils. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A baseflow separation model called meteorology-corrected nonlinear reservoir algorithm (MNRA) was developed by combining nonlinear reservoir algorithm with a meteorological regression model, in which the effects of meteorological factors on daily baseflow recession were fully expressed. Using MNRA and the monitored data of daily streamflow and meteorological factors (including precipitation, evaporation, wind speed, water vapor pressure and relative humidity) from 2003 to 2012, we determined the daily, monthly, and yearly variations in baseflow from ChangLe River watershed, a typical rainy agricultural watershed in eastern China. Results showed that the estimated annual baseflow of the ChangLe River watershed varied from 18.8 cm (2004) to 61.9 cm (2012) with an average of 35.7 cm, and the baseflow index (the ratio of baseflow to streamflow) varied from 0.58 (2007) to 0.74 (2003) with an average of 0.65. Comparative analysis of different methods showed that the meteorological regression statistical model was a better alternative to the Fourier fitted curve for daily recession parameter estimation. Thus, the reliability and accuracy of the baseflow separation was obviously improved by MNRA, i.e., the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency increased from 0.90 to 0.98. Compared with the Kalinin's and Eckhardt's recursive digital filter methods, the MNRA approach could usually be more sensitive for baseflow response to precipitation and obtained a higher goodness-of-fit for streamflow recession, especially in the area with high-level shallow groundwater and frequent rain.},

abstract = {The availability of in situ measurements of precipitation in remote locations is limited. As a result, the use of satellite measurements of precipitation is attractive for water resources management. Combined precipitation products that rely partially or entirely on satellite measurements are becoming increasingly available. However, these products have several weaknesses, for example their failure to capture certain types of precipitation, limited accuracy and limited spatial and temporal resolution. This paper evaluates the usefulness of several commonly used precipitation products over data scarce, complex mountainous terrain from a water resources perspective. Spatially averaged precipitation time series were generated or obtained for 16 sub-basins of the Paute river basin in the Ecuadorian Andes and 13 sub-basins of the Baker river basin in Chilean Patagonia. Precipitation time series were generated using the European Centre for Medium Weather Range Forecasting (ECMWF) 40year reanalysis (ERA-40) and the subsequent ERA-interim products, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset 1 (NCEP R1) hindcast products, as well as precipitation estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN). The Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B42 is also used for the Ecuadorian Andes. These datasets were compared to both spatially averaged gauged precipitation and river discharge. In general, the time series of the remotely sensed and hindcast products show a low correlation with locally observed precipitation data. Large biases are also observed between the different products. Hydrological verification based on river flows reveals that water balance errors can be extremely high for all evaluated products, including interpolated local data, in basins smaller than 1000km2. The observations are consistent over the two study regions despite very different climatic settings and hydrological processes, which is encouraging for extrapolation to other mountainous regions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding and modelling the relationship between rainfall and runoff has been a driving force in hydrology for many years. Baseflow separation and recession analysis have been two of the main tools for understanding runoff generation in catchments, but there are many different methods for each. The new baseflow separation method presented here (the bump and rise method or BRM) aims to accurately simulate the shape of tracer-determined baseflow or pre-event water. Application of the method by calibrating its parameters, using (a) tracer data or (b) an optimising method, is demonstrated for the Glendhu Catchment, New Zealand. The calibrated BRM algorithm is then applied to the Glendhu streamflow record. The new recession approach advances the thesis that recession analysis of streamflow alone gives misleading information on catchment storage reservoirs because streamflow is a varying mixture of components of very different origins and characteristics (at the simplest level, quickflow and baseflow as identified by the BRM method). Recession analyses of quickflow, baseflow and streamflow show that the steep power-law slopes often observed for streamflow at intermediate flows are artefacts due to mixing and are not representative of catchment reservoirs. Applying baseflow separation before recession analysis could therefore shed new light on water storage reservoirs in catchments and possibly resolve some current problems with recession analysis. Among other things it shows that both quickflow and baseflow reservoirs in the studied catchment have (non-linear) quadratic characteristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Storage of water within a river basin is often estimated by analyzing recession flow curves as it cannot be 'instantly' estimated with the aid of available technologies. In this study we explicitly deal with the issue of estimation of 'drainable' storage, which is equal to the area under the 'complete' recession flow curve (i.e. a discharge vs. time curve where discharge continuously decreases till it approaches zero). But a major challenge in this regard is that recession curves are rarely 'complete' due to short inter-storm time intervals. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and model recession flows meaningfully. We adopt the well-known Brutsaert and Nieber analytical method that expresses time derivative of discharge (dQ/dt) as a power law function of Q:-dQ/dt=kQ{\textless}sup{\textgreater}??{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. However, the problem with dQ/dt-Q analysis is that it is not suitable for late recession flows. Traditional studies often compute ?? considering early recession flows and assume that its value is constant for the whole recession event. But this approach gives unrealistic results when ?????2, a common case. We address this issue here by using the recently proposed geomorphological recession flow model (GRFM) that exploits the dynamics of active drainage networks. According to the model, ?? is close to 2 for early recession flows and 0 for late recession flows. We then derive a simple expression for drainable storage in terms the power law coefficient k, obtained by considering early recession flows only, and basin area. Using 121 complete recession curves from 27 USGS basins we show that predicted drainable storage matches well with observed drainable storage, indicating that the model can also reliably estimate drainable storage for 'incomplete' recession events to address many challenges related to water resources.},

Measurement techniques are not in accordance with the scales at which information on soil moisture is needed. In situ point measurements are expensive and provide information only at a few select points. On the other hand, the spatial resolution of remote sensing data is too coarse for hydrologic applications. Currently, surface soil moisture evolution for heterogeneous fields subjected to rainfall conditions is achieved by a computationally intensive numerical solution of the Richards equation. To describe surface soil moisture evolution at local- and field-scale in an efficient manner, reference scaling curves are developed in this study based on a sharp front approximation and by adopting a log-normally distributed spatial hydraulic conductivity field. These scaling curves facilitate the determination of temporal evolution of surface soil moisture at any unmeasured location in the field, and can be used to obtain the field-scale surface soil moisture evolution for a single rainfall event. The scaling curves are computationally straight forward, and reduce the need for extensive soil moisture measurements at numerous locations in the field. Comparisons with experimental and numerical simulation results show that the proposed scaling curves hold promise for describing mean surface soil moisture evolution at the field-scale.},

abstract = {Mountainous headwaters include a variety of spatial landscape units; however, the flow contribution from different hydrologic components is complex and often unclear. In addition to complex landscape controls, temporal meteorological drivers play an important role in the distribution between surface runoff and subsurface storage changes. This spatiotemporal variability in partitioning can influence catchment-wide flow accumulation and nutrient and sediment loading. We use a multi-year, multi-method analysis of stable isotopes, geochemical indicators, and discharge distributed throughout the Haean catchment in South Korea to identify temporal variability in hydrologic flow partitioning from surface runoff, springs, shallow interflow, and groundwater under monsoonal conditions. By combining a weighted, multi-method discharge approach, high frequency, synoptic, catchment-wide isotopic and geochemical sampling, and baseflow analysis, we characterize watershed-scale spatiotemporal hydrologic flow partitioning. Meteorological drivers are spatially variable throughout the catchment and temporally between individual events. Baseflow contributions in the high elevation, forested areas are up to 50{\%}, while the majority of the catchment is approximately 20{\%}. Our study builds on previously reported seasonality of isotopic signatures by quantifying trends in distributed event-based partitioning of isotopic tracers. We demonstrate that high frequency flow partitioning can accurately be determined in mountainous topography with high precipitation and that there is a need for multiple method characterizations. Our results further show the benefit of spatially distributed synoptic sampling for process understanding of hydrologic partitioning throughout the watersheds.},

Their analysis through recession fragments provides information on the type of response of the sub-surface and subterranean systems and on the average relation between the storage and discharge of aquifers, starting from the joining of these fragments into a single curve, the Master Recession Curve (MRC). This paper presents the generation of the downward MRC over fragments selected after a preliminary analysis of the recession curves, using a hydrological model as the methodology for the identification and the characterization of quick sub-surface flows flowing through fractured materials. The hydrological calculation has identified recession fragments through surface runoff or snowmelt and those periods of intense evapotranspiration. The proposed methodology has been applied to three sub-basins belonging to a high altitude mountain basin in the Mediterranean area, with snow present every year, and their results were compared with those for the upward concatenation of the recession fragments. The results show the existence of two different responses, one quick (at the sub-surface, through the fractured material) and the other slow, with linear behaviour which takes place in periods of 10 and 17 days respectively and which is linked to the dimensions of the sub-basin. In addition, recesses belonging to the dry season have been selected in order to compare and validate the results corresponding to the study of recession fragments. The comparison, using these two methodologies, which differ in the time period selected, has allowed us to validate the results obtained for the slow flow.},

To improve the management of the water regulation structures, there is a need to develop rainfall-runoff models to both maximize the storage capacity and reduce the risks caused by floods. In this study, a model is developed to reproduce the flood events for a 655 km2 catchment located upstream of the 6th largest dam in Morocco. Constrained by data availability, a standard event-based model combining a SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service Curve Number) loss model and a Clark unit hydrograph was developed for hourly discharge simulation using 16 flood events that occurred between 1984 and 2008. The model was found satisfactory to reproduce the runoff and the temporal evolution of floods, even with limited rainfall data. Several antecedent wetness conditions estimators for the catchment were compared with the initial condition of the model. Theses estimators include an antecedent discharge index, an antecedent precipitation index and a continuous daily soil moisture accounting model (SMA), based on precipitation and evapotranspiration. The SMA model performed the best to estimate the initial conditions of the event-based hydrological model ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}2 Combining double low line 0.9). Its daily output has been compared with ASCAT and AMSR-E remote sensing data products, which were both able to reproduce with accuracy the daily simulated soil moisture dynamics at the catchment scale. This same approach could be implemented in other catchments of this region for operational purposes. The Results of this study suggest that remote sensing data are potentially useful to estimate the soil moisture conditions in the case of ungauged catchments in Northern Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

The literature on soil moisture is very extensive and is developing so rapidly that it might be considered ambitious to seek to present the state of the art concerning research into this key variable. Even when covering investigations about only one aspect of the problem, there is a risk of some inevitable omission. A specific feature of the present essay, which may make this overview if not comprehensive at least of particular interest, is that the reader is guided through the various traditional and more up-to-date methods by the central thread of techniques developed to measure soil moisture interwoven with applications of modeling tools that exploit the observed datasets.This paper restricts its analysis to the evolution of soil moisture at the local (spatial) scale. Though a somewhat loosely defined term, it is linked here to a characteristic length of the soil volume investigated by the soil moisture sensing probe. After presenting the most common concepts and definitions about the amount of water stored in a certain volume of soil close to the land surface, this paper proceeds to review ground-based methods for monitoring soil moisture and evaluates modeling tools for the analysis of the gathered information in various applications. Concluding remarks address questions of monitoring and modeling of soil moisture at scales larger than the local scale with the related issue of data aggregation. An extensive, but not exhaustive, list of references is provided, enabling the reader to gain further insights into this subject.},

We use here an existing geomorphological interpretation of recession dynamics, which links the exponent in the classic recession curve -dQ / dt = kQ?? to the geometric properties of the time-varying drainage network to study the general properties of recession curves across a wide variety of river basins. In particular, we show how the parameter k depends on the initial soil moisture state of the basin and can be made to explicitly depend on an index discharge, representative of initial sub-subsurface storage. Through this framework we obtain a non-dimensional, event-independent, recession curve. We subsequently quantify the variability of k across different basins on the basis of their geometry, and, by rescaling, collapse curves from different events and basins to obtain a generalized, or 'universal', recession curve. Finally, we analyze the resulting normalized recession curves and explain their universal characteristics, lending further support to the notion that the statistical properties of observed recession curves bear the signature of the geomorphological structure of the networks producing them. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable in hydrological processes. Although the combined effects of multiple climatic factors in different land cover conditions are highly valuable for water resource management, a complete understanding of these effects remains unclear. This study used a cluster analysis approach to investigate the combined effects of precipitation and air temperature, rather than a single factor, in different land covers for an area over the Poyang Lake Basin in China from 2003 to 2009. Specifically, monthly soil moisture was classified into eight clusters according to the change in precipitation and air temperature; the clusters describe a range of climates from the extreme of wet-hot to that of dry-cold. For an individual climate factor, our results showed that the contribution of air temperature to soil moisture is greater than that of precipitation, and the effect of air temperature is more sensitive in different land covers. When considering the combined effects of precipitation and air temperature, soil moisture varies with land cover; however, the variation in a normal climate cluster is greater than in an extreme climate cluster. This indicated that land cover is the dominant factor in soil moisture variation in normal climatic conditions, whereas climate is the dominant factor in extreme conditions. As climate shifts from the wet-hot to the dry-cold cluster, soil moisture decreases for all land covers, with the minimum rate occurring in forest conditions. Meanwhile, soil moisture deficit and saturation are more likely to occur in grassland and forest areas, indicating that forest cover might mitigate drought. The results of this study provide an effective approach to investigate the combined effects of climate factors on soil moisture for various land covers in humid areas. This study also supports the management of water resources in changing climates.},

Results from an existing automated digital filter technique for separating baseflow from daily streamflow records were compared to baseflow estimates made in the six water balance studies. Previous validation of automated baseflow separation techniques consisted only of comparisons with manual techniques. In this study, the automated digital filter technique was found to compare well with measured field estimates yielding a monthly coefficient of determination of 0.86. The recharge algorithm developed in this study is an automated derivation of the Rorabaugh hydrograph recession curve displacement method that utilizes daily streamflow. Comparison of annual recharge from field water balance measurements to those computed with the automated recession curve displacement method had coefficients of determination of 0.76 and predictive efficiencies of 71 percent. Monthly estimates showed more variation and are not advocated for use with this method. These techniques appear to be fast, reproducible methods for estimating baseflow and annual recharge and should be useful in regional modeling efforts and as a quick check on mass balance techniques for shallow water table aquifers.},

abstract = {Baseflow is often considered to be the groundwater discharge component of streamflow. It is commonly estimated using conceptual models, recursive filters or a combination of the two. However, it is difficult to validate these methods due to the current challenges of measuring baseflow in the field. In this study, simulation of a synthetic catchment's response to rainfall is carried out using a fully integrated surface water-groundwater flow model. A series of rainfall events with differing recovery periods and varied antecedent moisture conditions is considered to span a range of different streamflow generation dynamics. Baseflow is estimated for the outlet hydrograph of the synthetic catchment using a selection of commonly used automated baseflow separation methods. These estimates are compared to the baseflow signal obtained from the numerical model, which serves as the control experiment. Results from these comparisons show that depending on the method used, automated baseflow separation underestimates the simulated baseflow by as much as 28{\%}, or overestimates it by up to 74{\%}, during rainfall events. No separation method is found to be clearly superior to the others, as the performance of the various methods varies with different soil types, antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall events. The differences between the various approaches clearly demonstrate that the baseflow separation methods investigated are not universally applicable. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Streamflow recession has been investigated by a variety of methods, often involving the fit of a model to empirical recession plots to parameterize a non-linear storage–outflow relationship based on the dQ/dt−Q method. Such recession analysis methods (RAMs) are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity, storage capacity, or aquifer thickness and to model streamflow recession curves for regionalization and prediction at the catchment scale. Numerous RAMs have been published, but little is known about how comparably the resulting recession models distinguish characteristic catchment behavior. In this study we combined three established recession extraction methods with three different parameter-fitting methods to the power-law storage–outflow model to compare the range of recession characteristics that result from the application of these different RAMs. Resulting recession characteristics including recession time and corresponding storage depletion were evaluated for 20 meso-scale catchments in Germany. We found plausible ranges for model parameterization; however, calculated recession characteristics varied over two orders of magnitude. While recession characteristics of the 20 catchments derived with the different methods correlate strongly, particularly for the RAMs that use the same extraction method, not all rank the catchments consistently, and the differences among some of the methods are larger than among the catchments. To elucidate this variability we discuss the ambiguous roles of recession extraction procedures and the parameterization of the storage–outflow model and the limitations of the presented recession plots. The results suggest strong limitations to the comparability of recession characteristics derived with different methods, not only in the model parameters but also in the relative characterization of different catchments. A multiple-methods approach to investigating streamflow recession characteristics should be considered for applications whenever possible.},

For this reason, landslide hazard assessment and the capacity to predict this phenomenon have been topics of great interest within the scientific community for the implementation of early warning systems. Although several models have been proposed to forecast shallow landslides triggered by rainfall, few models have incorporated geotechnical factors into a complete hydrological model of a basin that can simulate the storage and movement of rainwater through the soil profile. These basin and full hydrological models have adopted a physically based approach. This paper develops a conceptual and physically based model called open and distributed hydrological simulation and landslides—SHIA{\_}Landslide (Simulaci{\'{o}}n HIdrol{\'{o}}gica Abierta, or SHIA, in Spanish)—that is supported by geotechnical and hydrological features occurring on a basin-wide scale in tropical and mountainous terrains. SHIA{\_}Landslide is an original and significant contribution that offers a new perspective with which to analyse shallow landslide processes by incorporating a comprehensive distributed hydrological tank model that includes water storage in the soil coupled with a classical analysis of infinite slope stability under saturated conditions. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be distinguished by the following: (i) its capacity to capture surface topography and effects concerning the subsurface flow; (ii) its use of digital terrain model (DTM) to establish the relationships among cells, geomorphological parameters, slope angle, direction, etc.; (iii) its continuous simulation of rainfall data over long periods and event simulations of specific storms; (iv) its consideration of the effects of horizontal and vertical flow; and (vi) its inclusion of a hydrologically complete water process that allows for hydrological calibration. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be combined with real-time rainfall data and implemented in early warning systems.},

Snow initialization has a major impact on skill during the spring melting season. Soil moisture initialization has a smaller but still statistically significant impact during this season, and in other seasons, its contribution to skill dominates. Realistic soil moisture initiali- zation can contribute to skill at long leads (over 6 months) for certain basins and seasons.

We employ the concepts of "spatial moments of catchment rainfall" and "catchment scale storm velocity" to quantify the effect of spatial rainfall variability and basin geomorphology on flood response. A calibrated distributed hydrologic model is employed to assess the relevance of these statistics in describing the degree of spatial rainfall organization, which is important for runoff modeling. Furthermore, the Tar River Basin is divided into four nested sub-basins ranging from 1106km2 to 5654km2, in order to investigate the scale dependence of results. The rainfall spatiotemporal distribution represented in the analytical framework is shown to describe well the differences in hydrograph timing (less so in terms of magnitude of the simulated hydrographs) determined from forcing the hydrologic model with lumped vs. distributed rainfall. Specifically, the first moment exhibits a linear relationship with the difference in timing between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing. The analysis shows that the catchment scale storm velocity is scale dependent in terms of variability and rainfall dependent in terms of its value, assuming typically small values. Accordingly, the error in dispersion of simulated hydrographs between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing is relatively insensitive to the catchment scale storm velocity, which is attributed to the spatial variability of routing and hillslope velocities that is not accounted by the conceptual framework used in this study. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The characterization of the spatial-temporal variability of soil moisture is of paramount importance in many scientific fields and operational applications. However, due to the high variability of soil moisture, its monitoring over large areas and for extended periods through in situ point measurements is not straightforward. Usually, in the scientific literature, soil moisture variability has been investigated over short periods and in large areas or over long periods but in small areas. In this study, an effort to understanding soil moisture variability at catchment scale ({\textgreater}100km 
                        2), which is the size needed for some hydrological applications and for remote sensing validation analysis, is done. Specifically, measurements were carried out in two adjacent areas located in central Italy with extension of 178 and 242km 
                        2 and over a period of 1year (35 sampling days) with almost weekly frequency except for the summer period because of soil hardness. For each area, 46 sites were monitored and, for each site, 3 measurements were performed to obtain reliable soil moisture estimates. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 0-15cm. A statistical and temporal stability analysis is employed to assess the space-time variability of soil moisture at local and catchment scale. Moreover, by comparing the results with those obtained in previous studies conducted in the same study area, a synthesis of soil moisture variability for a range of spatial scales, from few square meters to several square kilometers, is attempted. For the investigated area, the two main findings inferred are: (1) the spatial variability of soil moisture increases with the area up to {\~{}}10km 
                        2 and then remains quite constant with an average coefficient of variation equal to {\~{}}0.20; (2) regardless of the areal extension, the soil moisture exhibits temporal stability features and, hence, few measurements can be used to infer areal mean values with a good accuracy (determination coefficient higher than 0.88). These insights based on in situ soil moisture observations corroborate the opportunity to use point information for the validation of coarse resolution satellite images. Moreover, the feasibility to use coarse resolution data for hydrological applications in small to medium sized catchments is confirmed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The main focus of this study was to investigate the actual impact of soil moisture initial conditions on the performance of flood forecasting models and the possible compensations with updating techniques. The rainfall-runoff model assimilation technique we used does not impact the SMA component of the model but only its routing part. Tests were made by running the SMA store continuously or on event basis, everything else being equal. The results show that the continuous approach remains the reference to ensure good forecasting performances. We show, however, that the possibility to assimilate the last observed flow considerably reduces the differences in performance.

abstract = {Most studies to date in the humid tropics have described a similar pattern of rapid translation of rainfall to runoff via overland flow and shallow subsurface stormflow. However, study sites have been few overall, and one particular system has received very little attention so far: tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) on volcanic substrate. While TMCFs provide critical ecosystem services, our understanding of runoff generation processes in these environments is limited. Here, we present a study aimed at identifying the dominant water sources and pathways and mean residence times of soil water and streamflow for a first-order, TMCF catchment on volcanic substrate in central eastern Mexico. During a 6-week wetting-up cycle in the 2009 wet season, total rainfall was 1200 mm and storm event runoff ratios increased progressively from 11 to 54{\%}. With the increasing antecedent wetness conditions, our isotope and chemical-based hydrograph separation analysis showed increases of pre-event water contributions to the storm hydrograph, from 35 to 99{\%}. Stable isotope-based mean residence times estimates showed that soil water aged only vertically through the soil profile from 5 weeks at 30 cm depth to 6 months at 120 cm depth. A preliminary estimate of 3 years was obtained for base flow residence time. These findings all suggest that shallow lateral pathways are not the controlling processes in this tropical forest catchment; rather, the high permeability of soils and substrate lead to vertical rainfall percolation and recharge of deeper layers, and rainfall-runoff responses appeared to be dominated by groundwater discharge from within the hillslope.},

Many methods for base flow separation exist, but hardly one focuses on the specific behaviour of temperate lowland areas. This paper presents the results of a base flow separation study carried out in a lowland area in the Netherlands. In this study, field observations of precipitation, groundwater and surface water levels and discharges, together with tracer analysis are used to understand the runoff generation processes in the catchment. Several tracer and non-tracer based base flow separation methods were applied to the discharge time series, and their results are compared. The results show that groundwater levels react fast to precipitation events in this lowland area with shallow groundwater tables. Moreover, a good correlation was found between groundwater levels and discharges suggesting that most of the measured discharge also during floods comes from groundwater storage. It was estimated using tracer hydro logical approaches that approximately 90{\%} of the total discharge is groundwater displaced by event water mainly infiltrating in the northern part of the catchment, and only the remaining 10{\%} is surface runoff. The impact of remote recharge causing displacement of near channel ground water during floods could also be motivated with hydraulic approximations. The results show further that when base flow separation is meant to identify groundwater contributions to stream flow, process based methods (e.g. the rating curve method; Kliner and Knezek, 1974) are more reliable than other simple non-tracer based methods. Also, the recursive filtering method (proposed by Eckhardt, 2005) can be calibrated well using the results of tracer investigation giving good results. Consequently, non-tracer based base flow separation methods that can be validated for some events may provide a powerful tool for groundwater assessment or model calibration/validation in lowland areas. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2009.},

Stephenson (Guest-Editors), Contemporary Hydrogeology - The George Burke Maxey Memorial Volume. J. Hydrol., 43: 45-65. Groundwater plays a much more active, responsive and significant role in the generation, of storm and snow-melt runoff in streams than the recent literature on the subject suggests. Basin-wide tracer experiments using environmental isotopes (18O, deuterium, tritium) and hydrometric studies carried out in hydrogeologically diverse watersheds, indicate that for all except the most intense rain storms and the most prolific melting days, groundwater dominates the runoff hydrographs in the study basins. The increased groundwater discharge during runoff events is apparently related to a rapid rise in hydraulic head along the perimeter of transient and perennial discharge areas. This groundwater ridging phenomenon probably arises from the almost instantaneous conversion of the near-surface tension-saturated capillary fringe into phreatic water. The ridging precedes, and is apparently independent of the response of the rest of the basin. In addition to its compatibility with several of the field observations commonly associated with contemporary concepts of runoff generation, the groundwater discharge theory explains some of the temporal variations in stream water chemistry which are not adequately accounted for by other theories.},

abstract = {The interaction between streams and groundwater controls key features of the stream hydrograph and chemograph. Since surface runoff is usually less saline than groundwater, flow events are usually accompanied by declines in stream salinity. In this paper, we use numerical modelling to show that, at any particular monitoring location: (i) the increase in stream stage associated with a flow event will precede the decrease in solute concentration (arrival time lag for solutes); and (ii) the decrease in stream stage following the flow peak will usually precede the subsequent return (increase) in solute concentration (return time lag). Both arrival time lag and return time lag increase with increasing wave duration. However, arrival time lag decreases with increasing wave amplitude, whereas return time lag increases. Furthermore, while arrival time lag is most sensitive to parameters that control river velocity (channel roughness and stream slope), return time lag is most sensitive to groundwater parameters (aquifer hydraulic conductivity, recharge rate, and dispersitivity). Additionally, the absolute magnitude of the decrease in river concentration is sensitive to both river and groundwater parameters. Our simulations also show that in-stream mixing is dominated by wave propagation and bank storage processes, and in-stream dispersion has a relatively minor effect on solute concentrations. This has important implications for spreading of contaminants released to streams. Our work also demonstrates that a high contribution of pre-event water (or groundwater) within the flow hydrograph can be caused by the combination of in-stream and bank storage exchange processes, and does not require transport of pre-event water through the catchment.},

abstract = {Hydrograph separation of runoff events in two nested alpine/subalpine basins in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia was carried out using electrical conductivity, specific concentrations of silica and the stable isotopes oxygen-18 and deuterium as hydrological tracers. The methods predicted consistent high pre-storm water contribution for the subalpine site (60-90{\%}) but more variable contribution at the alpine basin outlet (25-90{\%}). The pre-storm water contribution is much larger than had previously been expected. Precipitation is believed to run off as overland flow due to the steep slopes in combination with the hydrophobic soils until it can enter the subsurface environment. The rapid influx of stored water is possibly caused by pressure propagation in the macropore system which could be enhanced by the heavily fractured bedrock and permeable landslide debris acting as efficient hydrological conduits. The study suggests that alternative hydrological tracers such as electrical conductivity and silica concentration can be used under certain hydrological and lithological conditions. These alternative tracers should, however, be verified against more conventional tracers before use, as the behaviour depends on specific characteristics of each basin. At the upper basin outlet, both electrical conductivity (EC) and silica underestimated the pre-storm contribution. At the lower station, silica and EC showed a similar pattern to deuterium and oxygen-18 tracers. The calculated pre-storm component using EC was, however, 10-20{\%} lower than the calculated values from the other three tracers. The advantage of using these alternative tracers is that hydrograph separation results can, a priori, be anticipated.},

abstract = {This study uses a long-term (8years) dataset of radar-rainfall and runoff observations for the Tar River Basin in North Carolina, to explore the rainfall space-time organization control on the flood response of mild-slope (max slope {\textless}32 degrees) basins. We employ the concepts of "spatial moments of catchment rainfall" and "catchment scale storm velocity" to quantify the effect of spatial rainfall variability and basin geomorphology on flood response. A calibrated distributed hydrologic model is employed to assess the relevance of these statistics in describing the degree of spatial rainfall organization, which is important for runoff modeling. Furthermore, the Tar River Basin is divided into four nested sub-basins ranging from 1106km2 to 5654km2, in order to investigate the scale dependence of results. The rainfall spatiotemporal distribution represented in the analytical framework is shown to describe well the differences in hydrograph timing (less so in terms of magnitude of the simulated hydrographs) determined from forcing the hydrologic model with lumped vs. distributed rainfall. Specifically, the first moment exhibits a linear relationship with the difference in timing between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing. The analysis shows that the catchment scale storm velocity is scale dependent in terms of variability and rainfall dependent in terms of its value, assuming typically small values. Accordingly, the error in dispersion of simulated hydrographs between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing is relatively insensitive to the catchment scale storm velocity, which is attributed to the spatial variability of routing and hillslope velocities that is not accounted by the conceptual framework used in this study. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Subsurface stormflow is an important component of the rainfall-runoff response, especially in steep terrain. Its contribution to total runoff is, however, poorly represented in the current generation of land surface models. The lack of physical basis of these common parameterizations precludes a priori estimation of the stormflow (i.e. without calibration), which is a major drawback for prediction in ungauged basins, or for use in global land surface models. This paper is aimed at deriving regionalized parameterizations of the storage-discharge relationship relating to subsurface stormflow from a top-down empirical data analysis of streamflow recession curves extracted from 50 eastern United States catchments. Detailed regression analyses were performed between parameters of the empirical storage-discharge relationships and the controlling climate, soil and topographic characteristics. The regression analyses performed on empirical recession curves at catchment scale indicated that the coefficient of the power-law form storage-discharge relationship is closely related to the catchment hydrologic characteristics, which is consistent with the hydraulic theory derived mainly at the hillslope scale. As for the exponent, besides the role of field scale soil hydraulic properties as suggested by hydraulic theory, it is found to be more strongly affected by climate (aridity) at the catchment scale. At a fundamental level these results point to the need for more detailed exploration of the co-dependence of soil, vegetation and topography with climate.},

To this end, 23 measurement campaigns were carried out during a period of 8months at 5 sites located in central Italy, within a catchment of {\~{}}6km2. The sites are characterized by different land uses: grassland, woodland (holm oak and hornbeam) olive grove and cropland. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 15cm under the soil surface. The optimization of the monitoring scheme was addressed through a statistical and temporal stability analysis. Notwithstanding the significant differences in the land use, the temporal patterns of the field-mean soil moisture of the different sites were very similar while the spatial variability, expressed through the coefficient of variation, was found slightly higher (average value equal to 0.27) than that obtained from previous sampling campaigns on the same area but on sites characterized by a homogeneous soil use. The maximum number of required samples, to estimate the areal mean soil moisture within an accuracy of 2{\%} vol/vol, was found ranging between 7 and 11 at the field scale and equal to 20 at the catchment scale. The temporal stability analysis allowed to identify the grassland site as the most representative of the catchment-mean soil moisture behavior (coefficient of determination, R2=0.96). Therefore, even though the heterogeneity of the land use increases the spatial variability (as expected), soil moisture exhibits a significant temporal stability and its large scale monitoring from few observations is still feasible.},

@article{Ferket2010,
abstract = {An important tool in the management of floods is the use of rainfall-runoff models to predict the arrival of discharge peaks. These models generally use rainfall and potential evapotranspiration rates as input, and relate these to the catchment discharge through a number of conceptual equations. The parameters of these equations are estimated through a comparison of the modeled discharge to the observations. Only one variable, catchment discharge, is thus generally used to calibrate and validate these models. The objective of this paper is to validate the internal model dynamics of two widely used rainfall-runoff models using baseflow estimates. The baseflow time series used in this paper are obtained through the use of a physically-based digital baseflow filter. These models, the Hydrologiska Byr??ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model and the Probability Distributed Model (PDM), were calibrated using 1 year of hourly discharge data. The HBV model uses a linear reservoir for the modeling of groundwater flow, while the PDM uses a cubic reservoir for this purpose. In order to assess the impact of the type of reservoir choice, the cubic reservoir in the PDM was also replaced by a linear reservoir. Two different parameter estimation algorithms were used for model calibration. The Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm minimizes the Root Mean Square Error between the model simulations and the observations, while Multistart Weight-Adaptive Recursive Parameter Estimation (MWARPE) uses the Extended Kalman Filter equations in an iterative, Monte-Carlo framework. MWARPE was found to lead to the best discharge simulations, but the differences with the results obtained from the SCE-UA algorithm were relatively small. When only the modeled discharge was analyzed, no clear picture emerged of which model produced the best results. However, it has been found that the replacement of the cubic groundwater reservoir in the PDM by a linear reservoir resulted in a strongly improved model performance with respect to the baseflow. Further, MWARPE consistently led to the best baseflow estimates for the three models, while the HBV model resulted in the best simulations of the baseflow, regardless of the calibration algorithm. The overall conclusion of this paper is that, even though it may be difficult to assess which model and calibration algorithm resulted in the best discharge estimates, the MWARPE calibration algorithm and the HBV model consistently led to the best internal model dynamics. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The inclusion of expert knowledge in data-driven streamflow modeling is expected to yield more accurate estimates of river quantities. Modular models (MMs) designed to work on different parts of the hydrograph are preferred ways to implement such approach. Previous studies have suggested that better predictions of total streamflow could be obtained via modular Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained to perform an implicit baseflow separation. These MMs fit separately the baseflow and excess flow components as produced by a digital filter, and reconstruct the total flow by adding these two signals at the output. The optimization of the filter parameters and ANN architectures is carried out through global search techniques. Despite the favorable premises, the real effectiveness of such MMs has been tested only on a few case studies, and the quality of the baseflow separation they perform has never been thoroughly assessed. In this work, we compare the performance of MM against global models (GMs) for nine different gaging stations in the northern United States. Binary-coded swarm optimization is employed for the identification of filter parameters and model structure, while Extreme Learning Machines, instead of ANN, are used to drastically reduce the large computational times required to perform the experiments. The results show that there is no evidence that MM outperform global GM for predicting the total flow. In addition, the baseflow produced by the MM largely underestimates the actual baseflow component expected for most of the considered gages. This occurs because the values of the filter parameters maximizing overall accuracy do not reflect the geological characteristics of the river basins. The results indeed show that setting the filter parameters according to expert knowledge results in accurate baseflow separation but lower accuracy of total flow predictions, suggesting that these two objectives are intrinsically conflicting rather than compatible.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of the power law relationship between dQ / dt and Q for recession periods (-dQ / dt = kQ??, Q being discharge at the basin outlet at time t) clearly hints at the existence of a dominant recession flow process that is common to all real basins. It is commonly assumed that a basin, during recession events, functions as a single phreatic aquifer resting on a impermeable horizontal bed or the Dupuit-Boussinesq (DB) aquifer, and with time different aquifer geometric conditions arise that give different values of ?? and k. The recently proposed alternative model, geomorphological recession flow model, however, suggests that recession flows are controlled primarily by the dynamics of the active drainage network (ADN). In this study we use data for several basins and compare the above two contrasting recession flow models in order to understand which of the above two factors dominates during recession periods in steep basins. Particularly, we do the comparison by selecting three key recession flow properties: (1) power law exponent ??, (2) dynamic dQ / dt-Q relationship (characterized by k) and (3) recession timescale (time period for which a recession event lasts). Our observations suggest that neither drainage from phreatic aquifers nor evapotranspiration significantly controls recession flows. Results show that the value of ?? and recession timescale are not modeled well by DB aquifer model. However, the above mentioned three recession curve properties can be captured satisfactorily by considering the dynamics of the ADN as described by geomorphological recession flow model, possibly indicating that the ADN represents not just phreatic aquifers but the organization of various sub-surface storage systems within the basin. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The relationship between the groundwater discharge and the reservoir storage of shallow unconfined aquifers was found to be nonlinear based on the analysis of numerous streamflow recession curves. However, depletion of groundwater by evapotranspiration losses, through the water uptake of tree roots, was found to bias the recession curves and the estimated reservoir parameters. As a result of the seasonality of both rainfall and potential evaporation, analysis of the recession curves, stratified according to time of the year, allowed the quantification of evapotranspiration loss as a function of calendar month and stored groundwater storage. Time series of recharge to the groundwater aquifer were computed from the observed total streamflows, and the estimated discharge and evapotranspiration losses, by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. Using traditional unit hydrograph methods unit recharge responses to rainfall were computed by least squares fitting.

abstract = {Mountainous headwaters include a variety of spatial landscape units; however, the flow contribution from different hydrologic components is complex and often unclear. In addition to complex landscape controls, temporal meteorological drivers play an important role in the distribution between surface runoff and subsurface storage changes. This spatiotemporal variability in partitioning can influence catchment-wide flow accumulation and nutrient and sediment loading. We use a multi-year, multi-method analysis of stable isotopes, geochemical indicators, and discharge distributed throughout the Haean catchment in South Korea to identify temporal variability in hydrologic flow partitioning from surface runoff, springs, shallow interflow, and groundwater under monsoonal conditions. By combining a weighted, multi-method discharge approach, high frequency, synoptic, catchment-wide isotopic and geochemical sampling, and baseflow analysis, we characterize watershed-scale spatiotemporal hydrologic flow partitioning. Meteorological drivers are spatially variable throughout the catchment and temporally between individual events. Baseflow contributions in the high elevation, forested areas are up to 50{\%}, while the majority of the catchment is approximately 20{\%}. Our study builds on previously reported seasonality of isotopic signatures by quantifying trends in distributed event-based partitioning of isotopic tracers. We demonstrate that high frequency flow partitioning can accurately be determined in mountainous topography with high precipitation and that there is a need for multiple method characterizations. Our results further show the benefit of spatially distributed synoptic sampling for process understanding of hydrologic partitioning throughout the watersheds.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that improvements in the regional prediction of low-flow characteristics can be obtained through the inclusion of a parameter characterising catchment baseflow recession. Usually, a linear reservoir model is assumed to define recession characteristics used as predictors in regional models. We propose in this study to adopt instead a non-linear model. Predictors derived from the linear model and the non-linear model are used separately in low-flow regional models along with other predictors representing physiographical and meteorological characteristics. These models are applied to selected gaged catchments. Results show that better performances are obtained with the parameter from the non-linear model. One drawback of using recession parameters for regional estimation is that a streamflow record is required at the site of interest. However, recession parameters can be estimated with short streamflow records. In this study, to simulate the performances obtained at partially gaged catchments, the recession parameters are estimated with very short streamflow records at target sites. Results indicate that, with a streamflow record as short as one year, a model with a recession parameter from the non-linear model leads to better performances than a model with only physiographical and meteorological characteristics.},

abstract = {An automated base now separation technique has been developed and tested. Base flow is considered to be the ground-water contribution to stream now. Estimates of the amount of base flow can be derived from stream flow records. Such estimates are critical in the assessment of low flow characteristics of streams for use in water supply, water management, and pollution assessment. An automated base flow separation technique using a digital filter has been tested against three other automated techniques and manual separation methods. The filter appears to be comparable to other automated techniques in its ability to reproduce the results produced from graphical separation techiques. The filter technique is easy to use and has the added advantage in that it can be adjusted by the user to take into account personnel preferences in separation of stream now into surface flow and base flow. The slope of the base flow recession has been used to estimate the volume of water in storage in the basin above the level of the stream channel, the amount of recharge to the shallow aquifer, and as an input into water budget models. A second automated technique was developed to calculate the slope of the base flow recession curve from stream flow record. This technique is an adaptation of the Master Recession Curve procedure. The results of this method were compared to manual estimates with an efficiency of 74 percent.},

abstract = {Abstract A revised framework for the analysis of soil moisture memory characteristics of climate models and observational data is derived from the approach proposed by Koster and Suarez. The resulting equation allows the expression of the month-to-month soil moisture autocorrelation as a function of 1) the initial soil moisture variability, 2) the (atmospheric) forcing variability over the considered time period, 3) the correlation between initial soil moisture and subsequent forcing, 4) the sensitivity of evaporation to soil moisture, and 5) the sensitivity of runoff to soil moisture. A specific new feature is the disentangling of the roles of initial soil moisture variability and forcing variability, which were both (for the latter indirectly) contributing to the seasonality term of the original formulation. In addition, a version of the framework entirely based on explicit equations for the underlying relationships (i.e., independent of soil moisture statistics at the following time step) is proposed. ...},

abstract = {The Himalayan region of Nepal and northern India experiences hydrological extremes from monsoonal floods during July to September, when most of the annual precipitation falls, to periods of very low flows during the dry season (December to February). While the monsoon floods cause acute disasters such as loss of human life and property, mudslides and infrastructure damage, the lack of water during the dry season has a chronic impact on the lives of local people. The management of water resources in the region is hampered by relatively sparse hydrometerological networks and consequently, many resource assessments are required in catchments where no measurements exist. A hydrological model for estimating dry season flows in ungauged catchments, based on recession curve behaviour, has been developed to address this problem. Observed flows were fitted to a second order storage model to enable average annual recession behaviour to be examined. Regionalised models were developed, using a calibration set of 26 catchments, to predict three recession curve parameters: the storage constant; the initial recession flow and the start date of the recession. Relationships were identified between: the storage constant and catchment area; the initial recession flow and elevation (acting as a surrogate for rainfall); and the start date of the recession and geographic location. An independent set of 13 catchments was used to evaluate the robustness of the models. The regional models predicted the average volume of water in an annual recession period (1st of October to the 1st of February) with an average error of 8{\%}, while mid-January flows were predicted to within ±50{\%} for 79{\%} of the catchments in the data set.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p style="line-height: 20px;"{\textgreater}{\textless}b{\textgreater}Keywords: {\textless}/b{\textgreater}Himalaya, recession curve, water resources, ungauged catchment, regionalisation, low flows},

abstract = {Storage of water within a river basin is often estimated by analyzing recession flow curves as it cannot be 'instantly' estimated with the aid of available technologies. In this study we explicitly deal with the issue of estimation of 'drainable' storage, which is equal to the area under the 'complete' recession flow curve (i.e. a discharge vs. time curve where discharge continuously decreases till it approaches zero). But a major challenge in this regard is that recession curves are rarely 'complete' due to short inter-storm time intervals. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and model recession flows meaningfully. We adopt the well-known Brutsaert and Nieber analytical method that expresses time derivative of discharge (dQ/dt) as a power law function of Q:-dQ/dt=kQ{\textless}sup{\textgreater}??{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. However, the problem with dQ/dt-Q analysis is that it is not suitable for late recession flows. Traditional studies often compute ?? considering early recession flows and assume that its value is constant for the whole recession event. But this approach gives unrealistic results when ?????2, a common case. We address this issue here by using the recently proposed geomorphological recession flow model (GRFM) that exploits the dynamics of active drainage networks. According to the model, ?? is close to 2 for early recession flows and 0 for late recession flows. We then derive a simple expression for drainable storage in terms the power law coefficient k, obtained by considering early recession flows only, and basin area. Using 121 complete recession curves from 27 USGS basins we show that predicted drainable storage matches well with observed drainable storage, indicating that the model can also reliably estimate drainable storage for 'incomplete' recession events to address many challenges related to water resources.},

abstract = {This study presents an application of an inno- vative sampling strategy to assess soil moisture dynamics in a headwater of the Wei{\ss}eritz in the German eastern Ore Mountains. A grassland site and a forested site were in- strumented with two Spatial TDR clusters (STDR) that con- sist of 39 and 32 coated TDR probes of 60cm length. Dis- tributed time series of vertically averaged soil moisture data from both sites/ensembles were analyzed by statistical and geostatistical methods. Spatial variability and the spatial mean at the forested site were larger than at the grassland site. Furthermore, clustering of TDR probes in combination with long-term monitoring allowed identification of average spatial covariance structures at the small field scale for dif- ferent wetness states. The correlation length of soil water content as well as the sill to nugget ratio at the grassland site increased with increasing average wetness and but, in contrast, were constant at the forested site. As soil proper- ties at both the forested and grassland sites are extremely variable, this suggests that the correlation structure at the forested site is dominated by the pattern of throughfall and interception. We also found a very strong correlation be- tween antecedent soil moisture at the forested site and runoff coefficients of rainfall-runoff events observed at gauge Rehe- feld. Antecedent soil moisture at the forest site explains 92{\%} of the variability in the runoff coefficients. By combining these results with a recession analysis we derived a first con- ceptual model of the dominant runoff mechanisms operating in this catchment. Finally, we employed a physically based hydrological model to shed light on the controls of soil- and plant morphological parameters on soil average soil moisture at the forested site and the grassland site, respectively. A homogeneous soil setup allowed, after fine tuning of plant morphological parameters, most of the time unbiased predic- tions of the observed average soil conditions observed at both field sites. We conclude that the proposed sampling strategy of clustering TDR probes is suitable to assess unbiased aver- age soil moisture dynamics in critical functional units, in this case the forested site, which is a much better predictor for event scale runoff formation than pre-event discharge. Long term monitoring of such critical landscape elements could maybe yield valuable information for flood warning in head- waters. We thus think that STDR provides a good intersect of the advantages of permanent sampling and spatially highly resolved soil moisture sampling using mobile rods.},

abstract = {Turbid water can be the source of important sanitary problems in karstic regions. It is the case of the Pays de Caux, in Haute Normandie, where the main resource in drinking water is provided by the chalk aquifer. In the case of the typical binary karst of the Pays de Caux, turbidity results from the input in sinkholes of turbid surface water induced by erosion on the plateaus. At some spring tappings, water may be very turbid in period of intense rainfall. The turbidity observed at a karstic spring is a complex signal which contains a part of direct transfer and a part of resuspension of the particles being transported. The aim of this study is turbidigraph separation, which would permit to distinguish the direct transfer and resuspension components of the turbidigraph. These two components are separated by comparing the elementary surface storm-derived water fluxes and elementary turbidity signals at the spring. The procedure takes place in three phases: (i) spring hydrograph separation by means of a two components mixing model (surface water and karstic groundwater) using specific electrical conductivity, (ii) decomposition of storm-derived water flux and turbidity thanks to the second-derivative method, (iii) comparison of the transfer times (≈ modal times) of the elementary turbidity and surface water flux signals, respectively. The mass corresponding to direct transfer, computed after signal decomposition, is then used to re-calculate a particle recovery rate, which passes so from 51 ± 4 to 37 ± 3{\%}. Relations between particle flux and hydrodynamics show that resuspension can be either the fact of the dynamics of the introduction system, or that of the chalk karstic aquifer in general (case of resuspension not associated to surface water flux). In this sense, evolution of particle flux (and consequently of turbidity) can be also a marker of the karst structure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

One of the last contributions on this subject was given by Ekchardt (2005) who proposed a more general form of a digital baseflow filter and showed that some of the most used filters are special cases of this general form. This new filter has the inconvenience of having two parameters, one of them may be obtained directly from recession analysis, but the other (maximum baseflow index (BFImax)) is routinely estimated by a priori defined values according to the predominant geological characteristics of the drainage basin. In this short communication, we propose a method to estimate BFImax by a backwards filtering operation. The method was applied using data from 15 gauging stations in Brazil, with a varied range of groundwater contribution to streamflow. Results of the new estimation method for the BFImax parameter are coherent with the values which would be adopted by considering geological characteristics of the river basins.},

High-resolution deuterium mass spectrometry discriminated between storm sewer leaks and other water sources such as direct runoff, bank seepage, and groundwater flow to a stream channel. Isotope hydrograph separation indicates that groundwater or vadose water predominantly contributed to the volume of stream water compared to direct surface runoff during a storm event. Significant differences in delta D in the subsurface suggest that multiple flow components exist beyond the time period of a storm event.

abstract = {The ubiquity of the power law relationship between dQ / dt and Q for recession periods (-dQ / dt = kQ??, Q being discharge at the basin outlet at time t) clearly hints at the existence of a dominant recession flow process that is common to all real basins. It is commonly assumed that a basin, during recession events, functions as a single phreatic aquifer resting on a impermeable horizontal bed or the Dupuit-Boussinesq (DB) aquifer, and with time different aquifer geometric conditions arise that give different values of ?? and k. The recently proposed alternative model, geomorphological recession flow model, however, suggests that recession flows are controlled primarily by the dynamics of the active drainage network (ADN). In this study we use data for several basins and compare the above two contrasting recession flow models in order to understand which of the above two factors dominates during recession periods in steep basins. Particularly, we do the comparison by selecting three key recession flow properties: (1) power law exponent ??, (2) dynamic dQ / dt-Q relationship (characterized by k) and (3) recession timescale (time period for which a recession event lasts). Our observations suggest that neither drainage from phreatic aquifers nor evapotranspiration significantly controls recession flows. Results show that the value of ?? and recession timescale are not modeled well by DB aquifer model. However, the above mentioned three recession curve properties can be captured satisfactorily by considering the dynamics of the ADN as described by geomorphological recession flow model, possibly indicating that the ADN represents not just phreatic aquifers but the organization of various sub-surface storage systems within the basin. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The main objective of this study is to examine how R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} value of a basin is related with its physical characteristics. For this purpose, we use streamflow data from 358 basins in the United States and selected 18 physical parameters for each basin. First, we transform the physical parameters into mutually independent principal components. Then we employ multiple linear regression method to construct a model of R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in terms of the principal components. Furthermore, we employ step-wise multiple linear regression method to identify the dominant catchment characteristics that influence R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and their directions of influence. Our results indicate that R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is appreciably related to catchment characteristics. Particularly, it is noteworthy that the coefficient of determination of the relationship between R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and the catchment characteristics is 0.643 for N=45. We found that topographical characteristics of a basin are the most dominant factors in controlling the value of R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}.

abstract = {—As part of a long-range program on the hydrology of small watersheds, a corre­ lation between the two-year, one-hour rainfall intensity at 126 recording rainfall stations in northern California and related topographic and climatic parameters has been made. The re­ sulting correlation has a coefficient of correlation of 0.88 and a standard error of 0.067 inch/ hour. With this relation, it is possible to show the variation of rainfall intensity over the area in much greater detail than has hitherto been possible from observed intensity data alone. This paper discusses the parameters employed, the methods of correlation, and the results obtained. Introduction—One of the problems in any study of rainfall intensity is the limited number of stations with record suitable for frequency analy­ sis. For a regional study, data are limited to the hydrologic network stations available since about 1940. After preliminary study, it was decided to limit this analysis to California north of 35° N to avoid introducing large scale climatic factors. In this area approximately 150 station records were available for use. After screening to eliminate records which were too short or were composites from several station locations the number was reduced to 126. The maximum length of record was ten years and the average length substantially less. Conse­ quently the two-year, one hour intensity was adopted as the best choice of a dependent param­ eter. Since clock-hour data were readily avail­ able, these were used although the maximum 60-min values would be somewhat higher. Occasional summer thunderstdrms produce high-intensity rains in California. Because these storms are the result of quite different meterological processes, they were excluded from the analysis by using only the September through April period. Since most of these summer rains fall on dry ground and pro­ duce little runoff, this exclusion does not seem to affect the utility of the results. The general technique utilized is that previously employed by Spreen [1947] Burns [1952], and others for relating mean annual or mean seasonal pre­ cipitation to topography. The coaxial method of graphical correlation [Linsley and others, 1949] was employed because of the flexibility it offers. Since a relatively large number of stations was to be analyzed, data were transcribed onto Key sort punched cards. These cards could be easily strati­ fied and average values computed for each pa­ rameter as needed. The complete study [Linsley, 1956] involved comparison of four alternative relationships. This paper reports only the one which seems to offer the best results. Index daily rainfall—It is a logical assumption that, within a small region where the occurrence of rainfall at all stations is limited to about the same number of hours in a year, hourly intensities will bear some relation to mean annual precipita­ tion. The study area is too large for strict adherence to this assumption and a parameter called index daily rainfall was defined by},

abstract = {The cumulative impacts of urban land use change on natural stream flow regimes and lotic ecosystems are poorly understood, and generally under-studied within the hydrologic sciences literature. Moreover, flow assessments using daily or monthly flows cannot adequately characterize long-term trends in event-scale flow dynamics in urbanizing watersheds. Accordingly, we analyzed high temporal resolution (15-min flows) growing season discharge records for two urbanizing watersheds in Canada's Great Lakes Basin, the Don and Humber, over a 42-year period. Results show that total discharge between May 26th and November 15th in the mainstem rivers has increased by about 45{\%}, independent of total rainfall depth, over four decades. Peak rain event flow rates have increased by almost 0.1m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in both watersheds and event flow variability has increased two-fold in the Don and almost five-fold in the Humber. In the Don, the ratio of rising limb event flows to median flow (for the period May 26 to November 15) increased from 1.5 in the 1970's to 2.3 in the 2000's. A similar comparison of ratios in the Humber showed similar results, with higher variation in flow response Rising limb event flow acceleration increased 2-fold over 4 decades in the Don and slightly more in the Humber. This study provides a new understanding of the changes in event-scale flow regime dynamics associated with over four decades of intensive urbanization, including increased magnitude of rising limb flows and flow acceleration, and systematic increases in the variability of peak discharges. Overall, our analysis demonstrates marked alteration in total and event flow regimes resulting in chronic perturbation of stream flows. The results demonstrate an important application of long-term, high temporal resolution hydrological records. Furthermore, we quantify the degree to which hydrologic stationarity within the Don and Humber watersheds has been compromised over four decades, during a period prior to detectable climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns.},

abstract = {Although catchment behaviour during recession periods is better identifiable than in other periods, the representation of hydrograph recession is often weak in hydrological simulations. Among, the various aspects that influence model performance during low flows, in this paper we concentrate on those more inherently related to the modelling, such as the development of a suitable model conceptualization, and the choice of an appropriate calibration strategy. In this context we develop a methodology where the calibration procedure is combined with an iterative process of model improvement, to obtain an optimal model configuration that performs well both during low flows and high flows. The methodology starts by calculating a synthetic master recession curve that represents the long-term recession of a given catchment. Subsequently, using a simple reservoir model, we determine the storage-discharge relation that simulates the slow hydrograph component. This relation is determined without making any a-priori assumption on its form and is inferred from discharge data available through an iterative process. Next, high flow related parameters are recalibrated separately, to avoid that the simulation of low discharges is neglected in favour of a higher performance in simulating peak discharges. This methodology is applied on several catchments in Luxembourg, and as a result we determined that in all catchments except one (where human interference is high) within the chosen model structure a linear reservoir describes best the observed groundwater behaviour. This result is used to trigger a discussion as to the general suitability of the of a linear groundwater reservoir in hydrological modelling.},

abstract = {An objective common to many watershed studies is to separate storm hydrographs into two components: water that was present in the watershed prior to a storm event (soil moisture and groundwater) and water which fell on the watershed during the storm. To use this approach, a number of assumptions must be made including that the composition of water in the soil moisture and groundwater reservoirs are constant and known. The objective of this paper is to show that in settings where flow and transport are dominated by preferential pathways for flow, steady state mass balance calculations for quantitative hydrograph separation may be in error. We present field data from a site where flow and transport are dominated by preferential pathways (relict fractures in saprolite of sedimentary rocks) which indicate that the ??18O content of the water in the unsaturated and shallow saturated zones is not constant over the course of a storm event. We use a numerical model to further explore the interactions between the fractures and surrounding matrix. Both the field data and modeling results indicate that the ??18O of the previous storm event(s) has a strong influence on water in the fractures. On the time scale of a storm event, only the water in the matrix immediately surrounding the fracture mixes with water in the fracture, while the bulk of the matrix is isolated from fracture flow. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the ??18O in the subsurface and the isolation of the most of the matrix water from flow in fractures make the measurement of a singular ??18O value for subsurface reservoirs problematic and the assumption of a constant value doubtful. Since most near-surface geologic materials have preferential flow paths, we suggest that quantitative hydrograph separation using mass balance techniques is not possible in most situations. Future field and modeling investigations using the approach outlined here could be designed to explore the important temporal and spatial scales of variability in watersheds, and lead to a more quantitative approach to storm hydrograph separation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Understanding the pathways by which event water contributes to stream stormflow provides insight into stormflow generation mechanisms. We analyze the impact of storm size on the relative contribution of event water to stormflow by using natural variations in the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation and stream water to separate multiple stormflow hydrographs from a single fourth-order, 1212 ha catchment. We extend previous isotope-based hydrograph separations by independently accounting for the contribution of event water via direct channel precipitation to the stream hydrograph. The direct channel precipitation contribution is determined using a numerical model of stream flow routing though the catchment, taking precipitation and digital elevation data as input variables. For the range of storm sizes sampled, having recurrence intervals ranging from less than a week to ???4 months, essentially all the event water in stream stormflow can be attributed to direct channel precipitation. Event water not directly falling on the stream channel indirectly contributes to stormflow by increasing the subsurface discharge of pre-event water to the stream. Neither the hydrograph separation data, field observations during the precipitation events, nor experimental observations of flow in a large-scale natural soil column extracted from the watershed are consistent with macropore flow or groundwater ridging as the primary mechanism responsible for increasing subsurface discharge. Results from a series of artificial rain experiments using the unsaturated natural soil column are consistent with a preferential kinematic flow model and indicate that the discharge of pre-event water to the stream during a storm event may be controlled by kinematic flow processes within the watershed soils. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In this study, the influence of land use on soil moisture dynamics is investigated for monitoring purposes. To this end, 23 measurement campaigns were carried out during a period of 8months at 5 sites located in central Italy, within a catchment of {\~{}}6km2. The sites are characterized by different land uses: grassland, woodland (holm oak and hornbeam) olive grove and cropland. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 15cm under the soil surface. The optimization of the monitoring scheme was addressed through a statistical and temporal stability analysis. Notwithstanding the significant differences in the land use, the temporal patterns of the field-mean soil moisture of the different sites were very similar while the spatial variability, expressed through the coefficient of variation, was found slightly higher (average value equal to 0.27) than that obtained from previous sampling campaigns on the same area but on sites characterized by a homogeneous soil use. The maximum number of required samples, to estimate the areal mean soil moisture within an accuracy of 2{\%} vol/vol, was found ranging between 7 and 11 at the field scale and equal to 20 at the catchment scale. The temporal stability analysis allowed to identify the grassland site as the most representative of the catchment-mean soil moisture behavior (coefficient of determination, R2=0.96). Therefore, even though the heterogeneity of the land use increases the spatial variability (as expected), soil moisture exhibits a significant temporal stability and its large scale monitoring from few observations is still feasible.},

abstract = {The separation of storm hydrographs using stable isotope tracers dates back to the late 1960s. These studies ushered in a paradigm shift in how hydrologists conceptualized runoff generation as most showed a large preponderance of pre-event water in the storm hydrograph, even at peak flow. This forced a fundamental re-examination of the processes of water delivery to streams during rainfall and snowmelt events. Whilst the simplicity of the two-component hydrograph separation was a powerful tool for showing the importance of stored water effusion, the assumptions implicit in the two-component model have now become limiting for further advancement of the approach. Here we review the use of stable isotopes for hydrograph separation with particular reference to studies completed since the last comprehensive review of the subject in 1994. We review critically the contributions to new field knowledge gained by isotope hydrograph separation applications. We focus specifically on the current issues regarding the limitations of the two-component approach. We examine the role of soil water as a contributor to channel stormflow and the issues raised by differences in the soil water and groundwater signatures at the watershed scale. Finally, we offer ideas on how to overcome the limitations of the two-component approach and present a vision for future directions for isotope based hydrograph separation. These future directions are focused on high frequency analysis of rainfall-runoff structures and dual isotope analysis of catchment end-members including comparison of lysimeter-based soil water sampling of mobile soil water versus cryogenic and vapor-based analysis of tightly bound water. ?? 2013 .},

abstract = {—As part of a long-range program on the hydrology of small watersheds, a corre­ lation between the two-year, one-hour rainfall intensity at 126 recording rainfall stations in northern California and related topographic and climatic parameters has been made. The re­ sulting correlation has a coefficient of correlation of 0.88 and a standard error of 0.067 inch/ hour. With this relation, it is possible to show the variation of rainfall intensity over the area in much greater detail than has hitherto been possible from observed intensity data alone. This paper discusses the parameters employed, the methods of correlation, and the results obtained. Introduction—One of the problems in any study of rainfall intensity is the limited number of stations with record suitable for frequency analy­ sis. For a regional study, data are limited to the hydrologic network stations available since about 1940. After preliminary study, it was decided to limit this analysis to California north of 35° N to avoid introducing large scale climatic factors. In this area approximately 150 station records were available for use. After screening to eliminate records which were too short or were composites from several station locations the number was reduced to 126. The maximum length of record was ten years and the average length substantially less. Conse­ quently the two-year, one hour intensity was adopted as the best choice of a dependent param­ eter. Since clock-hour data were readily avail­ able, these were used although the maximum 60-min values would be somewhat higher. Occasional summer thunderstdrms produce high-intensity rains in California. Because these storms are the result of quite different meterological processes, they were excluded from the analysis by using only the September through April period. Since most of these summer rains fall on dry ground and pro­ duce little runoff, this exclusion does not seem to affect the utility of the results. The general technique utilized is that previously employed by Spreen [1947] Burns [1952], and others for relating mean annual or mean seasonal pre­ cipitation to topography. The coaxial method of graphical correlation [Linsley and others, 1949] was employed because of the flexibility it offers. Since a relatively large number of stations was to be analyzed, data were transcribed onto Key sort punched cards. These cards could be easily strati­ fied and average values computed for each pa­ rameter as needed. The complete study [Linsley, 1956] involved comparison of four alternative relationships. This paper reports only the one which seems to offer the best results. Index daily rainfall—It is a logical assumption that, within a small region where the occurrence of rainfall at all stations is limited to about the same number of hours in a year, hourly intensities will bear some relation to mean annual precipita­ tion. The study area is too large for strict adherence to this assumption and a parameter called index daily rainfall was defined by},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the use of a two-component hydrograph separation model to predict the leaching of two relatively soluble herbicides, isoproturon and simazine, from an agricultural drained clay soil. The model successfully predicted the pattern and extent of herbicide leaching in drainflow at a 15-min time interval using electrical conductivity of rainfall and drainflow as the single chemical parameter. Analysis of the hydrological characteristics of individual rainfall events allowed current sources of uncertainty in the model to be identified and highlighted areas for further research. For example, future use of the model should incorporate the measurement of intra-event variations in electrical conductivity of rainfall as an input in order to improve model accuracy and precision. Repeated under-estimation of herbicide concentration in drainflow when suspended sediment concentrations were elevated indicated that desorption hysteresis may have occurred at the soil surface and during transport through the tile drain system. This resulted in the transport of a greater proportion of herbicide through preferential pathways in sediment-associated form than predicted by assuming an instantaneous desorption at the soil surface. The results of the research suggest that the nature and importance of sediment-associated herbicide transport through tile drains warrants further investigation. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The strength of the k-Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} relationship is characterized by the coefficient of determination R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, which is expected to indicate the basin's ability to hold water for Ndays. The main objective of this study is to examine how R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} value of a basin is related with its physical characteristics. For this purpose, we use streamflow data from 358 basins in the United States and selected 18 physical parameters for each basin. First, we transform the physical parameters into mutually independent principal components. Then we employ multiple linear regression method to construct a model of R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in terms of the principal components. Furthermore, we employ step-wise multiple linear regression method to identify the dominant catchment characteristics that influence R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and their directions of influence. Our results indicate that R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is appreciably related to catchment characteristics. Particularly, it is noteworthy that the coefficient of determination of the relationship between R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and the catchment characteristics is 0.643 for N=45. We found that topographical characteristics of a basin are the most dominant factors in controlling the value of R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. Our results may be suggesting that it is possible to tell about the water holding capacity of a basin by just knowing about a few of its physical characteristics.},

abstract = {It is widely recognised that soil slips and debris flows are triggered by short intense storms. Owing its geologic, geomorphologic and climatic settings, the Piedmont Region (NW Italy) is highly prone to the occurrence of this kind of landslides. In the last two centuries, in fact, a total of 105 severe meteoric events which triggered shallow failures occurred and, of these, 18 events took place from 1990 to 2002. A fair number of rainfall thresholds have been proposed in the literature, defined both on empirical or on physical bases. Empirical thresholds are defined collecting rainfall data for landslide meteoric events and for events without landslides, while physical thresholds are based on numerical models that consider the relation between rainfall, pore pressure and slope stability. The main objective of this paper is the identification of the empirical triggering thresholds for the Piedmont Region. Four meteoric events were selected and analysed (November 4-5, 1994; July 7-8, 1996; April 27-30, 2000; October 13-16, 2000) because they supply a wide range of variation for both rainfall parameters (duration, intensity, cumulative rainfalls) and the number of induced landslides. In the intensity-duration plot, the critical limit is described by the equation: I = 19D-0.50 (where I = rainfall intensity expressed in mm/h and D = rainfall duration expressed in hours). Such a limit is traced to envelop 90{\%} of the points on the graph. In the NI-D diagram the triggering thresholds are given by the equations NI = 0.76D-0.33 and NI = 4.62D-0.79 (where NI = normalised intensity with respect to the annual precipitation, MAP, expressed in {\%}, [(mm/h)/PMA] ?? 100). In the article the different meaning of these thresholds is discussed. Finally, the diagram NI-NCR is proposed; the triggering threshold is given by the expression: NI = -0.09ln[NCR] + 0.54 (where NCR is the normalised cumulative critical rainfall, [mm/PMA] ?? 100). The application of the triggering thresholds as a fundamental element in a warning system dedicated to the safeguarding of population in landslide-prone areas is discussed. In detail an operating procedure which is presently being verified and tested in the studied area is described. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Oxygen-18 is a stable, naturally occurring isotope of oxygen, whose concentration in a particular rainfall event may be quite different from its concentration in groundwater. It is on the basis of this difference that storm hydrographs recorded at seven stream gauges in the Big Creek and Big Otter Creek basins of Southern Ontario were separated into their components as to source. The storm hydrographs considered in this study were the result of a severe spring storm that triggered devastating floods in the adjacent, heavily populated, Grand River drainage area. Using the oxygen-18 technique, it was found that groundwater was the major component of storm runoff, providing more than 50{\%} of the peak discharge. These results are consistent with natural tracer studies on basins one to two orders of magnitude smaller and in different hydro- geologic environments. By comparing oxygen-18 and specific conductivity data, storm runoff was divided into groundwater, direct rainfall, and direct runoff components. On the basis of the oxygen-18 and specific conductivity data, it was concluded that storm runoff in the study area was generated primarily through increased groundwater discharge. It is believed that increased hydraulic gradients, near or at the stream channel, which develop quickly after a rainfall, are responsible for the increase in groundwater discharge.},

abstract = {Hillslope hydrology is concerned with the partition of precipitation as it passes through the vegetation and soil between overland flow and subsurface flow. Flow follows routes which attenuate and delay the flow to different extents, so that a knowledge of the relevant mechanisms is important. In the 1960s and 1970s, hillslope hydrology developed as a distinct topic through the application of new field observations to develop a generation of physically based forecasting models. In its short history, theory has continually been overturned by field observation. Thus the current tendency, particularly among temperate zone hydrologists, to dismiss all Hortonian overland flow as a myth, is now being corrected by a number of significant field studies which reveal the great range in both climatic and hillslope conditions. Some recent models have generally attempted to simplify the processes acting, for example including only vertical unsaturated flow and lateral saturated flows. Others explicitly forecast partial or contributing areas. With hindsight, the most complete and distributed models have generally shown little forecasting advantage over simpler approaches, perhaps trending towards reliable models which can run on desk top microcomputers. The variety now being recognised in hillslope hydrological responses should also lead to models which take account of more complex interactions, even if initially with a less secure physical and mathematical basis than the Richards equation. In particular, there is a need to respond to the variety of climatic responses, and to spatial variability on and beneath the surface, including the role of seepage macropores and pipes which call into question whether the hillside can be treated as a Darcian flow system. ?? 1988.},

Baseflow separation and recession analysis have been two of the main tools for understanding runoff generation in catchments, but there are many different methods for each and no consensus on how best to apply them. A new baseflow separation method is presented, which is justified by being based generally on the more objective tracer separation methods and by being optimised by fitting to the recession hydrograph. Using this baseflow separation method, the thesis is advanced that recession analysis should be applied to the separated components (quickflow and baseflow), because of their very different origins and characteristics, rather than to the streamflow itself because analysing the latter alone gives misleading results. Applying baseflow separation before recession analysis sheds new light on water storage in catchments and may resolve some current prob- lems with recession analysis. It may also have implications for rainfall–runoff modelling. Among other things it shows that both quickflow and baseflow reservoirs have non- linear (quadratic) characteristics in the studied catchment (Glendhu, New Zealand).},

abstract = {In this study, the influence of land use on soil moisture dynamics is investigated for monitoring purposes. To this end, 23 measurement campaigns were carried out during a period of 8months at 5 sites located in central Italy, within a catchment of {\~{}}6km2. The sites are characterized by different land uses: grassland, woodland (holm oak and hornbeam) olive grove and cropland. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 15cm under the soil surface. The optimization of the monitoring scheme was addressed through a statistical and temporal stability analysis. Notwithstanding the significant differences in the land use, the temporal patterns of the field-mean soil moisture of the different sites were very similar while the spatial variability, expressed through the coefficient of variation, was found slightly higher (average value equal to 0.27) than that obtained from previous sampling campaigns on the same area but on sites characterized by a homogeneous soil use. The maximum number of required samples, to estimate the areal mean soil moisture within an accuracy of 2{\%} vol/vol, was found ranging between 7 and 11 at the field scale and equal to 20 at the catchment scale. The temporal stability analysis allowed to identify the grassland site as the most representative of the catchment-mean soil moisture behavior (coefficient of determination, R2=0.96). Therefore, even though the heterogeneity of the land use increases the spatial variability (as expected), soil moisture exhibits a significant temporal stability and its large scale monitoring from few observations is still feasible.},

abstract = {To examine stream recession rates, hydrologists have plotted the rate of change in discharge (dQ/dt) versus the mean discharge (Q). Such plots typically result in a large cloud of data points where the slope of the lower bound of the cloud is often used to infer aquifer hydraulic properties as informed by certain interpretations of the Boussinesq Equation. For seven watersheds in New York State, USA ranging from 100km 2 to 6415km 2, we distinguish data points in the dQ/dt-Q plot belonging to individual recession events instead of looking at the entire data cloud. The recession curve of individual events consistently shifts upward during the summer and late fall (relative to spring and late fall curves) and much of the scatter in the data cloud appears to be due to seasonal variations in recession. We speculate that these seasonal variations in recession rate may be due to variations in watershed evapotranspiration (ET). Additionally, most individual recession events have slopes of approximately two when plotted as log dQ/dt versus logQ. Application of the Boussinesq Equation to watershed-scale recession date predicts slopes shifting from 3 to 3/2 as recession progresses, thus the observed slope of two casts doubt on whether it is appropriate to apply hydraulic aquifer theory to these types of watersheds to infer aquifer properties or predict low flows. As a further validation of the hydrologic information content of individual recession curves, the individual recession curves from time periods with minimal ET (early spring and late fall) were used to establish storage-discharge functions for two of the smaller watersheds. With these storage-discharge functions, a simple hydrologic model could reasonably simulate time series with minimal calibration (Nash-Sutcliffe R 2 of 0.71 and 0.67 on log transformed discharge). Overall, this paper suggests that the analysis of individual event recession curves (particularly when compared among watersheds and seasons) can be a valuable tool for gaining insights into hydrological processes at the scale of large watersheds and can justify alternatives to current low flow models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Hydrograph separation of runoff events in two nested alpine/subalpine basins in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia was carried out using electrical conductivity, specific concentrations of silica and the stable isotopes oxygen-18 and deuterium as hydrological tracers. The methods predicted consistent high pre-storm water contribution for the subalpine site (60-90{\%}) but more variable contribution at the alpine basin outlet (25-90{\%}). The pre-storm water contribution is much larger than had previously been expected. Precipitation is believed to run off as overland flow due to the steep slopes in combination with the hydrophobic soils until it can enter the subsurface environment. The rapid influx of stored water is possibly caused by pressure propagation in the macropore system which could be enhanced by the heavily fractured bedrock and permeable landslide debris acting as efficient hydrological conduits. The study suggests that alternative hydrological tracers such as electrical conductivity and silica concentration can be used under certain hydrological and lithological conditions. These alternative tracers should, however, be verified against more conventional tracers before use, as the behaviour depends on specific characteristics of each basin. At the upper basin outlet, both electrical conductivity (EC) and silica underestimated the pre-storm contribution. At the lower station, silica and EC showed a similar pattern to deuterium and oxygen-18 tracers. The calculated pre-storm component using EC was, however, 10-20{\%} lower than the calculated values from the other three tracers. The advantage of using these alternative tracers is that hydrograph separation results can, a priori, be anticipated.},

abstract = {Recession analysis across scales can provide insight into the spatial aggregation of hydrologic processes. Accordingly, we analyzed individual late-time recession curves from 25 nested USGS stream gauges over a period of {\~{}}150days with negligible precipitation during the 2012-2013 North American drought. These gauges are located in the Iowa and Cedar River basins and drain areas ranging from {\~{}}70 to 17,000km2. Our data analyses show that these late-time recession processes can be represented by a linear reservoir model with a constant recession time scale of about 34days, indicating linear and homogeneous recession behaviors at the large scales investigated. However, others have shown that the early-time recession process becomes more nonlinear as spatial scale and, thus, spatial variability increases. We developed a distributed drainage model as a diagnostic tool to understand these seemingly contradictory recession characteristics at multiple spatial scales and different stages. With a hierarchical description of the recession variability at the hillslope scale, our model can simultaneously produce the increasing nonlinear early-time and the linear and homogenous late-time recession behaviors at larger scales. The hierarchical representation classifies hillslopes according to the Strahler orders of the stream links into which they drain. We postulate that a larger difference in recession behaviors will occur between hillslopes from different orders than between those from the same order. Overall, this study shows how the spatial randomness and nonrandomness of small-scale process variability control the hydrologic responses at larger scales and suggests a combined (nonrandom-random) representation of watersheds for aggregating hydrologic processes.},

Snow initialization has a major impact on skill during the spring melting season. Soil moisture initialization has a smaller but still statistically significant impact during this season, and in other seasons, its contribution to skill dominates. Realistic soil moisture initiali- zation can contribute to skill at long leads (over 6 months) for certain basins and seasons. Skill levels in all seasons are found to be related to the ratio of initial total water storage (soil water plus snow) variance to the forecast period precipitation variance, allowing estimates of the potential for skill in areas outside the veri- fication basins.},

A specific new feature is the disentangling of the roles of initial soil moisture variability and forcing variability, which were both (for the latter indirectly) contributing to the seasonality term of the original formulation. In addition, a version of the framework entirely based on explicit equations for the underlying relationships (i.e., independent of soil moisture statistics at the following time step) is proposed. ...},

abstract = {The inclusion of expert knowledge in data-driven streamflow modeling is expected to yield more accurate estimates of river quantities. Modular models (MMs) designed to work on different parts of the hydrograph are preferred ways to implement such approach. Previous studies have suggested that better predictions of total streamflow could be obtained via modular Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained to perform an implicit baseflow separation. These MMs fit separately the baseflow and excess flow components as produced by a digital filter, and reconstruct the total flow by adding these two signals at the output. The optimization of the filter parameters and ANN architectures is carried out through global search techniques. Despite the favorable premises, the real effectiveness of such MMs has been tested only on a few case studies, and the quality of the baseflow separation they perform has never been thoroughly assessed. In this work, we compare the performance of MM against global models (GMs) for nine different gaging stations in the northern United States. Binary-coded swarm optimization is employed for the identification of filter parameters and model structure, while Extreme Learning Machines, instead of ANN, are used to drastically reduce the large computational times required to perform the experiments. The results show that there is no evidence that MM outperform global GM for predicting the total flow. In addition, the baseflow produced by the MM largely underestimates the actual baseflow component expected for most of the considered gages. This occurs because the values of the filter parameters maximizing overall accuracy do not reflect the geological characteristics of the river basins. The results indeed show that setting the filter parameters according to expert knowledge results in accurate baseflow separation but lower accuracy of total flow predictions, suggesting that these two objectives are intrinsically conflicting rather than compatible.},

Antecedent rainfall greatly influenced the dynamic contributions from various watershed components. During drier conditions at the beginning of the typhoon season, storm runoff was small ({\textless} 2.5{\%} of rainfall), largely generated by contributions from the narrow riparian zone. As wetness increased, subsurface flow from a hillslope segment contributed 2.0–3.4 times the runoff (on a unit contributing area basis) as the entire forest basin B. At least the lower 20{\%} of the hillslope appeared to contribute actively to subsurface stormflow during late season events with very wet antecedent conditions. During major storms with high antecedent moisture, macropore flow comprised more than 25{\%} of total subsurface flow during the peak and recession limbs of hydrographs. Almost no macropore flow occurred during storms with dry antecedent conditions.

Water yields during the two largest storms (with wet antecedent conditions) were higher in basin EB (16.6–25.6{\%}) than in basin B (11.6–19.5{\%}), partly owing to reduced canopy interception in the cutover portion of EB. During the two smallest storms (dry antecedent conditions) the opposite pattern occurred, likely because of the limited contributing area of stormflow near the stream channel.

abstract = {Methodologies for developing a macro-scale model of subsurface stormflow generation on a steep forested catchment in Japan are addressed. Field studies on this catchment have indicated that subsurface flow, consisting mainly of 'old' water displaced by 'new' rain water, dominates the storm response. Detailed field measurements on the catchment allowed simple, catchment-scale relationships to be developed between the volume of saturated groundwater, on the one hand, and discharge, and surface and subsurface saturated areas, on the other. Attempts are made to find linkages between these empirical relationships and physically-based descriptions of hydrological processes operating at smaller scales. A distributed model based on the saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow on steep catchments was developed and tested with field data collected on this catchment. Derivation of catchment-scale relationships can be carried out by a straightforward integration of the distributed model output. An alternative disaggregation-aggregation approach is presented, whereby the catchment is divided into a number of hillslope flow strips. By applying the distributed model on each flow strip, under steady-state conditions, it is possible to infer the spatial variability of groundwater volume in the various flow strips. This variability is related to a measure of hillslope topography and geometry. Knowing the catch-ment topography and geometry for any catchment, it is then possible to derive useful catchment-scale relationships which are applicable under quasi-steady-state conditions, Hydrological relationships derived in this manner are compared with corresponding empirical relationships. The methodologies presented are effective for understanding the linkages between catchment scale response and small-scale flow processes.},

abstract = {Hillslope hydrology is concerned with the partition of precipitation as it passes through the vegetation and soil between overland flow and subsurface flow. Flow follows routes which attenuate and delay the flow to different extents, so that a knowledge of the relevant mechanisms is important. In the 1960s and 1970s, hillslope hydrology developed as a distinct topic through the application of new field observations to develop a generation of physically based forecasting models. In its short history, theory has continually been overturned by field observation. Thus the current tendency, particularly among temperate zone hydrologists, to dismiss all Hortonian overland flow as a myth, is now being corrected by a number of significant field studies which reveal the great range in both climatic and hillslope conditions. Some recent models have generally attempted to simplify the processes acting, for example including only vertical unsaturated flow and lateral saturated flows. Others explicitly forecast partial or contributing areas. With hindsight, the most complete and distributed models have generally shown little forecasting advantage over simpler approaches, perhaps trending towards reliable models which can run on desk top microcomputers. The variety now being recognised in hillslope hydrological responses should also lead to models which take account of more complex interactions, even if initially with a less secure physical and mathematical basis than the Richards equation. In particular, there is a need to respond to the variety of climatic responses, and to spatial variability on and beneath the surface, including the role of seepage macropores and pipes which call into question whether the hillside can be treated as a Darcian flow system. ?? 1988.},

Usually, a linear reservoir model is assumed to define recession characteristics used as predictors in regional models. We propose in this study to adopt instead a non-linear model. Predictors derived from the linear model and the non-linear model are used separately in low-flow regional models along with other predictors representing physiographical and meteorological characteristics. These models are applied to selected gaged catchments. Results show that better performances are obtained with the parameter from the non-linear model. One drawback of using recession parameters for regional estimation is that a streamflow record is required at the site of interest. However, recession parameters can be estimated with short streamflow records. In this study, to simulate the performances obtained at partially gaged catchments, the recession parameters are estimated with very short streamflow records at target sites. Results indicate that, with a streamflow record as short as one year, a model with a recession parameter from the non-linear model leads to better performances than a model with only physiographical and meteorological characteristics.},

abstract = {Streamflow recession has been investigated by a variety of methods, often involving the fit of a model to empirical recession plots to parameterize a non-linear storage–outflow relationship based on the dQ/dt−Q method. Such recession analysis methods (RAMs) are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity, storage capacity, or aquifer thickness and to model streamflow recession curves for regionalization and prediction at the catchment scale. Numerous RAMs have been published, but little is known about how comparably the resulting recession models distinguish characteristic catchment behavior. In this study we combined three established recession extraction methods with three different parameter-fitting methods to the power-law storage–outflow model to compare the range of recession characteristics that result from the application of these different RAMs. Resulting recession characteristics including recession time and corresponding storage depletion were evaluated for 20 meso-scale catchments in Germany. We found plausible ranges for model parameterization; however, calculated recession characteristics varied over two orders of magnitude. While recession characteristics of the 20 catchments derived with the different methods correlate strongly, particularly for the RAMs that use the same extraction method, not all rank the catchments consistently, and the differences among some of the methods are larger than among the catchments. To elucidate this variability we discuss the ambiguous roles of recession extraction procedures and the parameterization of the storage–outflow model and the limitations of the presented recession plots. The results suggest strong limitations to the comparability of recession characteristics derived with different methods, not only in the model parameters but also in the relative characterization of different catchments. A multiple-methods approach to investigating streamflow recession characteristics should be considered for applications whenever possible.},

abstract = {The study of recession flows offers fundamental insights into basin hydrological processes and, in particular, into the collective behavior of the governing dominant subsurface flows and properties. We use here an existing geomorphological interpretation of recession dynamics, which links the exponent in the classic recession curve -dQ / dt = kQ?? to the geometric properties of the time-varying drainage network to study the general properties of recession curves across a wide variety of river basins. In particular, we show how the parameter k depends on the initial soil moisture state of the basin and can be made to explicitly depend on an index discharge, representative of initial sub-subsurface storage. Through this framework we obtain a non-dimensional, event-independent, recession curve. We subsequently quantify the variability of k across different basins on the basis of their geometry, and, by rescaling, collapse curves from different events and basins to obtain a generalized, or 'universal', recession curve. Finally, we analyze the resulting normalized recession curves and explain their universal characteristics, lending further support to the notion that the statistical properties of observed recession curves bear the signature of the geomorphological structure of the networks producing them. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We evaluated the sensitivity of electromagnetic induction (EMI) method to variation in soil water in an irrigated cotton field by measuring apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) with a Geonics EM38. ECa was measured at a fixed position in each plot (within the furrow adjacent to stands of cotton planted on ridges) at ground level as well as at 0.1 and 0.4m height above the ground. Measurements were made in both vertical and horizontal modes (VM and HM) of EM38 to allow soil water sensing within 1.5 and 0.75m depths at each location. Surrogate values of soil water were obtained with a locally calibrated neutron probe adjacent to EM38 measurements.All measurements were carried out within three replicate plots of four irrigation treatments at various times during cotton growth. As EC is sensitive to variation in temperature, soil and air temperature was also measured at the time of EM38 measurements. Temporal patterns of variation in ECa and soil water were broadly similar for shallow and deep soil layers. Values of ECa over the season increased nonlinearly with increased values of accumulated soil water within specific depths with high degree of confidence (P???0.001) and high coefficient of determination (R2) for fitted models. Although both soil and air temperature varied over the season (21.2-39.1??C for soil and 26.1-33.2??C for air), dependency of ECa on temperature was weak. The relationship between ECa and soil water was greatly affected by surface configuration in crop fields (i.e. whether the crop was planted on a flat bed or a raised bed) and season. Thus, there is a need to calibrate the EMI equipment to suit local condition in order to measure soil water distribution at field scale.},

We also performed a rain-on-snow experiment where we sampled leachate from a melting snow core continuously at 2 min intervals for 5 h. These data show remarkable fine-scale patterns of internal rain-snow mixing, patterns that would not have been detected without such high-frequency sampling.

abstract = {beginning of the typhoon season, storm runoff was small ({\textless} 2.5 {\%} of rainfall), largely generated by contributions from the narrow riparian zone. As wetness increased, subsurface flow from a hillslope segment contributed 2.0-3.4 times the runoff (on a unit contributing area basis) as the entire forest basin B. At least the lower 20{\%} of the hillslope appeared to contribute actively to subsurface stormflow during late season events with very wet antecedent conditions. During major storms with high antecedent moisture, macropore flow comprised more than 25{\%} of total subsurface flow during the peak and recession limbs of hydrographs. Almost no macro- pore flow occurred during storms with dry antecedent conditions. Zero-order basins with shallow soils appear to contribute to stormflow once a threshold of saturation is reached; after this point these geomorphic hollows contribute similar magnitudes of flow (per unit area) as subsurface hillslope drainage. Water yields during the two largest storms (with wet antecedent conditions) were higher in basin EB (16.6-25.6{\%}) than in basin B (11.6-19.5{\%} ), partly owing to reduced canopy interception in the cutover portion of EB. During the two smallest storms (dry antecedent conditions) the opposite pattern occurred, likely because of the limited contributing area of stormflow near the stream channel. The dynamic hydrologic contributions of the near-channel zone, hillslope soils, and zero-order basins with respect to antecedent moisture and storm intensity offer new insights into the variable source area concept of streamflow generation and supplement more recent streamflow generation studies based on tracer tests.},

abstract = {Hydrologic processes that are components of regional water balance occur on scales considerably smaller than the region itself. Evapotranspiration and percolation during interstorm periods are hydrologic processes whose rates depend on conditions that vary significantly in space due to soil and vegetation heterogeneity as well as moisture redistribution under topography. Infiltration and runoff during storm periods also vary significantly in space due to the spatial variability in surface moisture conditions. In time, these hydrologic processes are switching between climate-limited and soil-controlled regimes during both storm and interstorm periods. The space and time dependence inherent in these components of water balance limit the applicability of lumped or averaged models. These simplified models appear in hydrologic applications whose objectives are to estimate regional water balance. They are also present in the hydrologic parametrization of atmospheric models. In this paper an analytical model of soil-water balance that is distributed in space and time is developed. In order to retain analytical tractability, it is assumed that the space-time variability is statistically homogeneous and isotropic. The surface hydrology is forced with a stochastic model of rainfall that phenomenologically captures the arrival of intense precipitating cells within clusters that are imbedded in squall lines and rainbands. An analysis of the spatial and temporal fluctuations in both the rainfields and soil moisture fields are made in frequency-domain. The effects of averaging operations on these fields are delineated and the consequences for hydrologic and atmospheric models that use lumped water balance expressions are quantified. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Subsurface stormflow is an important component of the rainfall-runoff response, especially in steep terrain. Its contribution to total runoff is, however, poorly represented in the current generation of land surface models. The lack of physical basis of these common parameterizations precludes a priori estimation of the stormflow (i.e. without calibration), which is a major drawback for prediction in ungauged basins, or for use in global land surface models. This paper is aimed at deriving regionalized parameterizations of the storage-discharge relationship relating to subsurface stormflow from a top-down empirical data analysis of streamflow recession curves extracted from 50 eastern United States catchments. Detailed regression analyses were performed between parameters of the empirical storage-discharge relationships and the controlling climate, soil and topographic characteristics. The regression analyses performed on empirical recession curves at catchment scale indicated that the coefficient of the power-law form storage-discharge relationship is closely related to the catchment hydrologic characteristics, which is consistent with the hydraulic theory derived mainly at the hillslope scale. As for the exponent, besides the role of field scale soil hydraulic properties as suggested by hydraulic theory, it is found to be more strongly affected by climate (aridity) at the catchment scale. At a fundamental level these results point to the need for more detailed exploration of the co-dependence of soil, vegetation and topography with climate.},

abstract = {A physically-based, spatially-distributed model is presented for simulation of surface/subsurface flow and the interactions between these domains. The model is designed for practical application to a wide variety of hydrologic evaluations, at various scales of simulation. The system is represented by the three-dimensional saturated-unsaturated flow equation for the subsurface, coupled with the diffusion wave equation for areal overland flow, both of which are coupled with the diffusion wave equation for flow through a network of streams and channels, including hydraulic structures. Ground surface unevenness at the grid scale is incorporated via the concept of detention storage, and thick vegetation or urban features are included via an obstruction storage exclusion term. Evapotranspiration from the surface and subsurface are modeled using land cover and climatic factors to define the complete water budget using a physically-based formulation. The system of equations is discretized using a fully implicit procedure, with the Newton-Raphson method to handle non-linearities efficiently. Robustness, stability and accuracy of solution are obtained for a wide variety of cases including dry systems and large surface/subsurface interaction fluxes. Adaptive time-stepping schemes and under-relaxation formulas further alleviate the computational burden. Verification and application examples demonstrate the need for a rigorous, fully-coupled solution to the set of equations, for complete hydrologic-cycle analysis. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Stephenson (Guest-Editors), Contemporary Hydrogeology - The George Burke Maxey Memorial Volume. J. Hydrol., 43: 45-65. Groundwater plays a much more active, responsive and significant role in the generation, of storm and snow-melt runoff in streams than the recent literature on the subject suggests. Basin-wide tracer experiments using environmental isotopes (18O, deuterium, tritium) and hydrometric studies carried out in hydrogeologically diverse watersheds, indicate that for all except the most intense rain storms and the most prolific melting days, groundwater dominates the runoff hydrographs in the study basins. The increased groundwater discharge during runoff events is apparently related to a rapid rise in hydraulic head along the perimeter of transient and perennial discharge areas. This groundwater ridging phenomenon probably arises from the almost instantaneous conversion of the near-surface tension-saturated capillary fringe into phreatic water. The ridging precedes, and is apparently independent of the response of the rest of the basin. In addition to its compatibility with several of the field observations commonly associated with contemporary concepts of runoff generation, the groundwater discharge theory explains some of the temporal variations in stream water chemistry which are not adequately accounted for by other theories.},

abstract = {Assessment of water resources available in different storages and moving along different pathways in a catchment is important for its optimal use and protection, and also for the prediction of floods and low flows. Moreover, understanding of the runoff generation processes is essential for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes on the hydro logical response of a catchment. Many methods for base flow separation exist, but hardly one focuses on the specific behaviour of temperate lowland areas. This paper presents the results of a base flow separation study carried out in a lowland area in the Netherlands. In this study, field observations of precipitation, groundwater and surface water levels and discharges, together with tracer analysis are used to understand the runoff generation processes in the catchment. Several tracer and non-tracer based base flow separation methods were applied to the discharge time series, and their results are compared. The results show that groundwater levels react fast to precipitation events in this lowland area with shallow groundwater tables. Moreover, a good correlation was found between groundwater levels and discharges suggesting that most of the measured discharge also during floods comes from groundwater storage. It was estimated using tracer hydro logical approaches that approximately 90{\%} of the total discharge is groundwater displaced by event water mainly infiltrating in the northern part of the catchment, and only the remaining 10{\%} is surface runoff. The impact of remote recharge causing displacement of near channel ground water during floods could also be motivated with hydraulic approximations. The results show further that when base flow separation is meant to identify groundwater contributions to stream flow, process based methods (e.g. the rating curve method; Kliner and Knezek, 1974) are more reliable than other simple non-tracer based methods. Also, the recursive filtering method (proposed by Eckhardt, 2005) can be calibrated well using the results of tracer investigation giving good results. Consequently, non-tracer based base flow separation methods that can be validated for some events may provide a powerful tool for groundwater assessment or model calibration/validation in lowland areas. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2009.},

abstract = {Turbid water can be the source of important sanitary problems in karstic regions. It is the case of the Pays de Caux, in Haute Normandie, where the main resource in drinking water is provided by the chalk aquifer. In the case of the typical binary karst of the Pays de Caux, turbidity results from the input in sinkholes of turbid surface water induced by erosion on the plateaus. At some spring tappings, water may be very turbid in period of intense rainfall. The turbidity observed at a karstic spring is a complex signal which contains a part of direct transfer and a part of resuspension of the particles being transported. The aim of this study is turbidigraph separation, which would permit to distinguish the direct transfer and resuspension components of the turbidigraph. These two components are separated by comparing the elementary surface storm-derived water fluxes and elementary turbidity signals at the spring. The procedure takes place in three phases: (i) spring hydrograph separation by means of a two components mixing model (surface water and karstic groundwater) using specific electrical conductivity, (ii) decomposition of storm-derived water flux and turbidity thanks to the second-derivative method, (iii) comparison of the transfer times (≈ modal times) of the elementary turbidity and surface water flux signals, respectively. The mass corresponding to direct transfer, computed after signal decomposition, is then used to re-calculate a particle recovery rate, which passes so from 51 ± 4 to 37 ± 3{\%}. Relations between particle flux and hydrodynamics show that resuspension can be either the fact of the dynamics of the introduction system, or that of the chalk karstic aquifer in general (case of resuspension not associated to surface water flux). In this sense, evolution of particle flux (and consequently of turbidity) can be also a marker of the karst structure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The separation of storm hydrographs using stable isotope tracers dates back to the late 1960s. These studies ushered in a paradigm shift in how hydrologists conceptualized runoff generation as most showed a large preponderance of pre-event water in the storm hydrograph, even at peak flow. This forced a fundamental re-examination of the processes of water delivery to streams during rainfall and snowmelt events. Whilst the simplicity of the two-component hydrograph separation was a powerful tool for showing the importance of stored water effusion, the assumptions implicit in the two-component model have now become limiting for further advancement of the approach. Here we review the use of stable isotopes for hydrograph separation with particular reference to studies completed since the last comprehensive review of the subject in 1994. We review critically the contributions to new field knowledge gained by isotope hydrograph separation applications. We focus specifically on the current issues regarding the limitations of the two-component approach. We examine the role of soil water as a contributor to channel stormflow and the issues raised by differences in the soil water and groundwater signatures at the watershed scale. Finally, we offer ideas on how to overcome the limitations of the two-component approach and present a vision for future directions for isotope based hydrograph separation. These future directions are focused on high frequency analysis of rainfall-runoff structures and dual isotope analysis of catchment end-members including comparison of lysimeter-based soil water sampling of mobile soil water versus cryogenic and vapor-based analysis of tightly bound water. ?? 2013 .},

abstract = {Most studies to date in the humid tropics have described a similar pattern of rapid translation of rainfall to runoff via overland flow and shallow subsurface stormflow. However, study sites have been few overall, and one particular system has received very little attention so far: tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) on volcanic substrate. While TMCFs provide critical ecosystem services, our understanding of runoff generation processes in these environments is limited. Here, we present a study aimed at identifying the dominant water sources and pathways and mean residence times of soil water and streamflow for a first-order, TMCF catchment on volcanic substrate in central eastern Mexico. During a 6-week wetting-up cycle in the 2009 wet season, total rainfall was 1200 mm and storm event runoff ratios increased progressively from 11 to 54{\%}. With the increasing antecedent wetness conditions, our isotope and chemical-based hydrograph separation analysis showed increases of pre-event water contributions to the storm hydrograph, from 35 to 99{\%}. Stable isotope-based mean residence times estimates showed that soil water aged only vertically through the soil profile from 5 weeks at 30 cm depth to 6 months at 120 cm depth. A preliminary estimate of 3 years was obtained for base flow residence time. These findings all suggest that shallow lateral pathways are not the controlling processes in this tropical forest catchment; rather, the high permeability of soils and substrate lead to vertical rainfall percolation and recharge of deeper layers, and rainfall-runoff responses appeared to be dominated by groundwater discharge from within the hillslope.},

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/hyp.3360090206.abs C. H. TAYLOR Methodological issues associated with isotopic hydrograph separations (IHSs) in built-up environments are explored using results from the 1990 spring melt in a suburban basin in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The hetrogeneous nature of suburban environments complicates the selection of appropriate isotopic signatures for event and pre-event waters. Near-stream groundwater $\delta$18O sampled from wells was poorly mixed, such that the pre-event water signature was best characterized by $\delta$18O in pre-melt baseflow or discharge from a headwater spring. The event water signature during snowmelt can be characterized using $\delta$18O in the pre-melt snowpack, surface runoff samples or meltwater from lysimeters. However, the use of snowpack $\delta$18O may be inappropriate in suburban basins where meltwater from thin snowcover may exhibit pronounced responses to $\delta$18O in rainfall contributions. Intensive sampling of the spatial variability of runoff or meltwater $\delta$18O may be required to characterize the average event water signature adequately. Rainfall $\delta$18O provided an appropriate event water signal during a large rain on snow event, and differences between this IHS and one generated using an event water signature that included meltwater contributions from snow-covered surfaces were within the uncertainty attributable to the analytical error in $\delta$18O values. Event water supplied 55-63{\%} of the peak discharge and 48-58{\%} of total runoff from the basin during the melt, which is consistent with the fraction of the basin that has been developed. These results contrast with IHSs conducted in forested basins that suggest that stormflow is dominated by pre-event water contributions.},

abstract = {The contribution of rainfall forcing errors relative to model (structural and parameter) uncertainty in the prediction of soil moisture is investigated by integrating the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM), forced with hydro-meteorological data, in the Oklahoma region. Rainfall-forcing uncertainty is introduced using a stochastic error model that generates ensemble rainfall fields from satellite rainfall products. The ensemble satellite rain fields are propagated through CLSM to produce soil moisture ensembles. Errors in CLSM are modeled with two different approaches: either by perturbing model parameters (representing model parameter uncertainty) or by adding randomly generated noise (representing model structure and parameter uncertainty) to the model prognostic variables. Our findings highlight that the method currently used in the NASA GEOS-5 Land Data Assimilation System to perturb CLSM variables poorly describes the uncertainty in the predicted soil moisture, even when combined with rainfall model perturbations. On the other hand, by adding model parameter perturbations to rainfall forcing perturbations, a better characterization of uncertainty in soil moisture simulations is observed. Specifically, an analysis of the rank histograms shows that the most consistent ensemble of soil moisture is obtained by combining rainfall and model parameter perturbations. When rainfall forcing and model prognostic perturbations are added, the rank histogram shows a U-shape at the domain average scale, which corresponds to a lack of variability in the forecast ensemble. The more accurate estimation of the soil moisture prediction uncertainty obtained by combining rainfall and parameter perturbations is encouraging for the application of this approach in ensemble data assimilation systems.},

abstract = {The interaction between streams and groundwater controls key features of the stream hydrograph and chemograph. Since surface runoff is usually less saline than groundwater, flow events are usually accompanied by declines in stream salinity. In this paper, we use numerical modelling to show that, at any particular monitoring location: (i) the increase in stream stage associated with a flow event will precede the decrease in solute concentration (arrival time lag for solutes); and (ii) the decrease in stream stage following the flow peak will usually precede the subsequent return (increase) in solute concentration (return time lag). Both arrival time lag and return time lag increase with increasing wave duration. However, arrival time lag decreases with increasing wave amplitude, whereas return time lag increases. Furthermore, while arrival time lag is most sensitive to parameters that control river velocity (channel roughness and stream slope), return time lag is most sensitive to groundwater parameters (aquifer hydraulic conductivity, recharge rate, and dispersitivity). Additionally, the absolute magnitude of the decrease in river concentration is sensitive to both river and groundwater parameters. Our simulations also show that in-stream mixing is dominated by wave propagation and bank storage processes, and in-stream dispersion has a relatively minor effect on solute concentrations. This has important implications for spreading of contaminants released to streams. Our work also demonstrates that a high contribution of pre-event water (or groundwater) within the flow hydrograph can be caused by the combination of in-stream and bank storage exchange processes, and does not require transport of pre-event water through the catchment.},

abstract = {Transfer of atmospheric N deposition on shallow-soil forested basins on the Canadian Shield to receiving water bodies may be enhanced by rapid preferential dow along the soil-bedrock interface (BR runoff) on basin slopes. Controls on BR runoff, partitioning of event and pre-event water contributions to this how, and implications of this partitioning for N fluxes in BR runoff were studied under natural and artificial inputs to an instrumented slope. BR runoff as a fraction of water inputs to the slope increased with antecedent soil wetness and input depth. Event water contributions to BR runoff initially increased with antecedent soil wetness, but then declined at large antecedent soil wetness, Export of applied NH4+ from the slope was maximized when event water contributions containing large NH4+ concentrations dominated BR runoff; however, there was no relationship between the fraction of NO3- application transported in BR runoff and either application input or the event mater fraction of that runoff. The applicability of our results to other shallow-soil areas of the Canadian Shield is limited by artificial N inputs to the slope in excess of natural loads and by low rates of N mineralization and negligible nitrification in the slope's soils. Nevertheless, the study reinforces the need to consider how the hydrologic, geometric and pedologic properties of forest slopes interact with biotic and abiotic soil processes to control N transport and transformation.

abstract = {Predictions in ungauged basins have been a major challenge in hydrologic sciences, and there is still much work needed to achieve robust and reliable predictions for such basins. Here, we propose and test a novel approach for predicting runoff from poorly gauged basins using a minimum complex model calibrated with isotope data alone (i.e., without observed discharge data). The model is composed of two water-stores (soil water and groundwater) and considers their connectivity to runoff in terms of both water and isotope budgets. In a meso-scale basin in which riverbed deformations frequently occur, making automatic observation of river discharge difficult, we measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition ($\delta$2H and $\delta$18O) of precipitation and river water twice-weekly for one year. Runoff predicted by the model agreed well with that observed monthly or bimonthly. Monte Carlo simulation revealed a strong coherence between model performance in isotope simulation and runoff prediction, demonstrating that the use of isotopes as dynamic proxies of calibration targets helps reliably constrain model parameters. Our results indicate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for prediction of runoff hydrographs, particularly for basins in which the stage-discharge relationship is highly variable.},

abstract = {A detailed uncertainty analysis of three-component mixing models based on the Haute-Mentue watershed (Switzerland) is presented. Two types of uncertainty are distinguished: the 'model uncertainty', which is affected by model assumptions, and the 'statistical uncertainty', which is due to temporal and spatial variability of chemical tracer concentrations of components. The statistical uncertainty is studied using a Monte Carlo procedure. The model uncertainty is investigated by the comparison of four different mixing models all based on the same tracers but considering for each component alternative hypotheses about their concentration and their spatio-temporal variability. This analysis indicates that despite the uncertainty, the flow sources, which generate the stream flow are clearly identified at the catchments scale by the application of the mixing model. However, the precision and the coherence of hydrograph separations can be improved by taking into account any available information about the temporal and spatial variability of component chemical concentrations. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The simple dynamical system approach was implemented to analyze, explain and simulate streamflow fluxes in diverse seasonal hydrological conditions within the forested Pade{\v{z}} stream catchment in SW Slovenia. The catchment is characterized by the flushing, torrential hydrological response conditioned by the flysch geological settings of a low hydraulic conductivity. Consequently, the streamflow formation is not controlled solely by the deeper subsurface catchment storage but is also strongly influenced by the rainfall–runoff that bypasses the deeper subsurface part of the total catchment storage. Therefore, fast component of the streamflow is identified using two-component hydrograph separation; the component recession behavior is described by a separate sensitivity function and used in a simple model to simulate the streamflow. According to the simulation results, the Pade{\v{z}} stream catchment behaves primarily like a deeper subsurface storage-dependent system during most of the hydrological conditions. When rainfall intensities increase (rainfall intensities close to 10mm/h or higher), triggering of the secondary streamflow formation mechanism described by separate, bypassing flow sensitivity function becomes evident and causes fast hydrograph formation with steeply rising and falling limbs. To be able to implement the modeling concept for streamflow predictions, the rainfall losses, most likely associated with interception losses not covered under the potential evapotranspiration calculation, would have to be more thoroughly analyzed through rainfall interception measurements. Our study shows the possible way that two hydrological concepts, the streamflow recession analysis and the two-component hydrograph separation based on relatively easily measurable tracers, such as electrical conductivity, could be combined for analyzing streamflow fluxes.},

abstract = {Despite increasing awareness about the importance of low flows and droughts, spatial and temporal variations in the quantity and quality of baseflow generated in larger catchments are poorly constrained. Here, tracers are used in conjunction with hydrometric analysis to examine the sources of baseflow in the 1849 km2 catchment of the River Dee in Scotland. Geochemical tracers showed that the chemical composition of baseflow evolved downstream, but mainly reflected the dominance of sources in montane tributaries in the upper catchment. These findings were corroborated by hydrometric analysis which showed that the upper 54{\%} of the catchment contributed 71{\%} of baseflow in the lower river. Baseflows in smaller ({\textless}10 km2) headwater sub-catchments exhibited highly variable hydrochemical characteristics which were averaged at larger scales. Analysis of ??18O implies that well-mixed groundwater sources with similar isotopic signatures dominated baseflow generation throughout most of the catchment, probably indicating that groundwater in the lower slopes of montane headwaters provide a major source of baseflow. Periods of baseflow were found to be dynamic; despite the river system being in overall recession, the channel network exhibited contrasting responses to relatively small ({\textless}10 mm) isolated rainfall events in different parts of the catchment. Moreover, diurnal variation in flows in sub-catchments with a high proportion of coverage by peat soils is apparent, which may reflect the daily variation of evapotranspiration as a control on baseflow. Although a relatively stable period in the hydrological year, baseflows in larger catchments result from a complex suite of distributed hydrological processes. Further research is needed to understand how baseflows sustain water supplies and aquatic ecosystems, if managers are to be able to protect these catchment services from environmental change. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The pattern of streamflow recession after rain events offers clues about the relationship between watershed runoff (observable as river discharge) and water storage (not directly observable) and can help in water resource assessment and prediction. However, there have been few systematic assessments of how streamflow recession varies across flow rates and how it relates to independent assessments of terrestrial water storage. We characterized the streamflow recession pattern in 61 relatively undisturbed small watersheds (1-100 km(2)) across the coterminous United States with multiyear records of hourly streamflow from automated gauges. We used the North American Regional Reanalysis to help identify periods where precipitation, snowmelt, and evaporation were small compared to streamflow. The order of magnitude of the recession timescale increases from 1 day at high flow rates (similar to 1 mm h(-1)) to 10 days at low flow rates (similar to 0.01 mm h(-1)), leveling off at low flow rates. There is significant variability in the recession timescale at a given flow rate between basins, which correlates with climate and geomorphic variables such as the ratio of mean streamflow to precipitation and soil water infiltration capacity. Stepwise multiple regression was used to construct a six-variable predictive model that explained some 80{\%} of the variance in recession timescale at high flow rates and 30-50{\%} at low flow rates. Seasonal and interannual variability in inferred storage shows similar time evolution to regional-scale water storage variability estimated from GRACE satellite gravity data and from land surface modeling forced by observed meteorology, but is up to a factor of 10 smaller. Study of this discrepancy in the inferred storage amplitude may provide clues to the range of validity of the recession curve approach to relating runoff and storage.},

abstract = {A grid-based flow routing and runoff-production model, configured to employ as input either observed or Regional Climate Model (RCM) estimates of precipitation and potential evaporation (PE), has previously been used to assess how climate change may impact river flows across the UK. The slope-based Grid-to-Grid (G2G) model adequately simulated observed river flows under current climate conditions for high relief catchments, but was less successful when applied to lower-relief and/or groundwater-dominated areas. The model has now been enhanced to employ a soil dataset to configure the probability-distributed store controlling soil-moisture and runoff generation within each grid-cell. A comparison is made of the ability of both models to simulate gauged river flows across a range of British catchments using observations of rainfall and PE as input. Superior performance from the enhanced G2G formulation incorporating the soil dataset is demonstrated. Following the model assessment, the observed precipitation and PE data used as input to both hydrological models were replaced by RCM estimates on a 25 km grid for a Current (1961-1990) and a Future (2071-2100) time-slice. Flood frequency curves derived from the flow simulations for the two time-slices are used to estimate, for the first time, maps of changes in flood magnitude for all river points on a 1 km grid across the UK. A high degree of spatial variability is seen in the estimated change in river flows, reflecting both projected climate change and the influences of landscape and climate variability. These maps also highlight large differences between the climate impact projections arising from the two models. The improved structure and performance of the soil-based G2G model adds confidence to its projections of flow changes being realistic consequences of the climate change scenario applied. A resampling method is used to identify regions where these projections may be considered robust. However, with the climate change scenario used representing only one plausible evolution of the future climate, no clear message can be drawn here about projected river flow changes.

abstract = {Recursive digital filtering of hydrographs is a baseflow separation method that can easily be automated and has been recommended for providing reproducible results. In the past, different formulations of the most simple filter type, the so-called one-parameter filter, have been proposed. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed for filter algorithms that were constructed under the assumption that the outflow from an aquifer is linearly proportional to its storage. It is shown that these one-parameter filters describing an exponential baseflow recession are all special cases of a two-parameter filter whose equation is specified. Its parameters are the recession constant—which can be objectively determined by a recession analysis—and BFImax, the maximum value of the baseflow index that can be modelled by the algorithm. This introduces a subjective element into the baseflow calculation, since BFImax is not measurable. A preliminary analysis based on the results of conventional separation techniques shows that it might be possible to find typical BFImax values for classes of catchments that can be unequivocally distinguished by their hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics.},

abstract = {A baseflow separation model called meteorology-corrected nonlinear reservoir algorithm (MNRA) was developed by combining nonlinear reservoir algorithm with a meteorological regression model, in which the effects of meteorological factors on daily baseflow recession were fully expressed. Using MNRA and the monitored data of daily streamflow and meteorological factors (including precipitation, evaporation, wind speed, water vapor pressure and relative humidity) from 2003 to 2012, we determined the daily, monthly, and yearly variations in baseflow from ChangLe River watershed, a typical rainy agricultural watershed in eastern China. Results showed that the estimated annual baseflow of the ChangLe River watershed varied from 18.8 cm (2004) to 61.9 cm (2012) with an average of 35.7 cm, and the baseflow index (the ratio of baseflow to streamflow) varied from 0.58 (2007) to 0.74 (2003) with an average of 0.65. Comparative analysis of different methods showed that the meteorological regression statistical model was a better alternative to the Fourier fitted curve for daily recession parameter estimation. Thus, the reliability and accuracy of the baseflow separation was obviously improved by MNRA, i.e., the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency increased from 0.90 to 0.98. Compared with the Kalinin's and Eckhardt's recursive digital filter methods, the MNRA approach could usually be more sensitive for baseflow response to precipitation and obtained a higher goodness-of-fit for streamflow recession, especially in the area with high-level shallow groundwater and frequent rain.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the use of a two-component hydrograph separation model to predict the leaching of two relatively soluble herbicides, isoproturon and simazine, from an agricultural drained clay soil. The model successfully predicted the pattern and extent of herbicide leaching in drainflow at a 15-min time interval using electrical conductivity of rainfall and drainflow as the single chemical parameter. Analysis of the hydrological characteristics of individual rainfall events allowed current sources of uncertainty in the model to be identified and highlighted areas for further research. For example, future use of the model should incorporate the measurement of intra-event variations in electrical conductivity of rainfall as an input in order to improve model accuracy and precision. Repeated under-estimation of herbicide concentration in drainflow when suspended sediment concentrations were elevated indicated that desorption hysteresis may have occurred at the soil surface and during transport through the tile drain system. This resulted in the transport of a greater proportion of herbicide through preferential pathways in sediment-associated form than predicted by assuming an instantaneous desorption at the soil surface. The results of the research suggest that the nature and importance of sediment-associated herbicide transport through tile drains warrants further investigation. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Its application, however, poses many methodical questions, and throughout the literature numerous solutions have been sought. The quantification of the recession curve involves the selection of an analytical expression, derivation of a characteristic recession and optimization of the recession parameters. A major problem is the high variability encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The segments represent different stages in the outflow process, and a physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession.

abstract = {An important tool in the management of floods is the use of rainfall-runoff models to predict the arrival of discharge peaks. These models generally use rainfall and potential evapotranspiration rates as input, and relate these to the catchment discharge through a number of conceptual equations. The parameters of these equations are estimated through a comparison of the modeled discharge to the observations. Only one variable, catchment discharge, is thus generally used to calibrate and validate these models. The objective of this paper is to validate the internal model dynamics of two widely used rainfall-runoff models using baseflow estimates. The baseflow time series used in this paper are obtained through the use of a physically-based digital baseflow filter. These models, the Hydrologiska Byr??ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model and the Probability Distributed Model (PDM), were calibrated using 1 year of hourly discharge data. The HBV model uses a linear reservoir for the modeling of groundwater flow, while the PDM uses a cubic reservoir for this purpose. In order to assess the impact of the type of reservoir choice, the cubic reservoir in the PDM was also replaced by a linear reservoir. Two different parameter estimation algorithms were used for model calibration. The Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm minimizes the Root Mean Square Error between the model simulations and the observations, while Multistart Weight-Adaptive Recursive Parameter Estimation (MWARPE) uses the Extended Kalman Filter equations in an iterative, Monte-Carlo framework. MWARPE was found to lead to the best discharge simulations, but the differences with the results obtained from the SCE-UA algorithm were relatively small. When only the modeled discharge was analyzed, no clear picture emerged of which model produced the best results. However, it has been found that the replacement of the cubic groundwater reservoir in the PDM by a linear reservoir resulted in a strongly improved model performance with respect to the baseflow. Further, MWARPE consistently led to the best baseflow estimates for the three models, while the HBV model resulted in the best simulations of the baseflow, regardless of the calibration algorithm. The overall conclusion of this paper is that, even though it may be difficult to assess which model and calibration algorithm resulted in the best discharge estimates, the MWARPE calibration algorithm and the HBV model consistently led to the best internal model dynamics. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Baseflow separation methods are often impractical, require expensive materials and time-consuming methods, and/or are not designed for individual events in small watersheds. To provide a simple baseflow separation method for small watersheds, we describe a new precipitation-based technique known as the Sliding Average with Rain Record (SARR). The SARR uses rainfall data to justify each separation of the hydrograph. SARR has several advantages such as: it shows better consistency with the precipitation and discharge records, it is easier and more practical to implement, and it includes a method of event identification based on precipitation and quickflow response. SARR was derived from the United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH) method with several key modifications to adapt it for small watersheds ({\textless}50km 2). We tested SARR on watersheds in the Choptank Basin on the Delmarva Peninsula (US Mid-Atlantic region) and compared the results with the UKIH method at the annual scale and the hydrochemical method at the individual event scale. Annually, SARR calculated a baseflow index that was ???10{\%} higher than the UKIH method due to the finer time step of SARR (1 d) compared to UKIH (5 d). At the watershed scale, hydric soils were an important driver of the annual baseflow index likely due to increased groundwater retention in hydric areas. At the event scale, SARR calculated less baseflow than the hydrochemical method, again because of the differences in time step (hourly for hydrochemical) and different definitions of baseflow. Both SARR and hydrochemical baseflow increased with event size, suggesting that baseflow contributions are more important during larger storms. To make SARR easy to implement, we have written a MatLab program to automate the calculations which requires only daily rainfall and daily flow data as inputs. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The availability of in situ measurements of precipitation in remote locations is limited. As a result, the use of satellite measurements of precipitation is attractive for water resources management. Combined precipitation products that rely partially or entirely on satellite measurements are becoming increasingly available. However, these products have several weaknesses, for example their failure to capture certain types of precipitation, limited accuracy and limited spatial and temporal resolution. This paper evaluates the usefulness of several commonly used precipitation products over data scarce, complex mountainous terrain from a water resources perspective. Spatially averaged precipitation time series were generated or obtained for 16 sub-basins of the Paute river basin in the Ecuadorian Andes and 13 sub-basins of the Baker river basin in Chilean Patagonia. Precipitation time series were generated using the European Centre for Medium Weather Range Forecasting (ECMWF) 40year reanalysis (ERA-40) and the subsequent ERA-interim products, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset 1 (NCEP R1) hindcast products, as well as precipitation estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN). The Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B42 is also used for the Ecuadorian Andes. These datasets were compared to both spatially averaged gauged precipitation and river discharge. In general, the time series of the remotely sensed and hindcast products show a low correlation with locally observed precipitation data. Large biases are also observed between the different products. Hydrological verification based on river flows reveals that water balance errors can be extremely high for all evaluated products, including interpolated local data, in basins smaller than 1000km2. The observations are consistent over the two study regions despite very different climatic settings and hydrological processes, which is encouraging for extrapolation to other mountainous regions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A detailed uncertainty analysis of three-component mixing models based on the Haute-Mentue watershed (Switzerland) is presented. Two types of uncertainty are distinguished: the 'model uncertainty', which is affected by model assumptions, and the 'statistical uncertainty', which is due to temporal and spatial variability of chemical tracer concentrations of components. The statistical uncertainty is studied using a Monte Carlo procedure. The model uncertainty is investigated by the comparison of four different mixing models all based on the same tracers but considering for each component alternative hypotheses about their concentration and their spatio-temporal variability. This analysis indicates that despite the uncertainty, the flow sources, which generate the stream flow are clearly identified at the catchments scale by the application of the mixing model. However, the precision and the coherence of hydrograph separations can be improved by taking into account any available information about the temporal and spatial variability of component chemical concentrations. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {It is widely recognised that soil slips and debris flows are triggered by short intense storms. Owing its geologic, geomorphologic and climatic settings, the Piedmont Region (NW Italy) is highly prone to the occurrence of this kind of landslides. In the last two centuries, in fact, a total of 105 severe meteoric events which triggered shallow failures occurred and, of these, 18 events took place from 1990 to 2002. A fair number of rainfall thresholds have been proposed in the literature, defined both on empirical or on physical bases. Empirical thresholds are defined collecting rainfall data for landslide meteoric events and for events without landslides, while physical thresholds are based on numerical models that consider the relation between rainfall, pore pressure and slope stability. The main objective of this paper is the identification of the empirical triggering thresholds for the Piedmont Region. Four meteoric events were selected and analysed (November 4-5, 1994; July 7-8, 1996; April 27-30, 2000; October 13-16, 2000) because they supply a wide range of variation for both rainfall parameters (duration, intensity, cumulative rainfalls) and the number of induced landslides. In the intensity-duration plot, the critical limit is described by the equation: I = 19D-0.50 (where I = rainfall intensity expressed in mm/h and D = rainfall duration expressed in hours). Such a limit is traced to envelop 90{\%} of the points on the graph. In the NI-D diagram the triggering thresholds are given by the equations NI = 0.76D-0.33 and NI = 4.62D-0.79 (where NI = normalised intensity with respect to the annual precipitation, MAP, expressed in {\%}, [(mm/h)/PMA] ?? 100). In the article the different meaning of these thresholds is discussed. Finally, the diagram NI-NCR is proposed; the triggering threshold is given by the expression: NI = -0.09ln[NCR] + 0.54 (where NCR is the normalised cumulative critical rainfall, [mm/PMA] ?? 100). The application of the triggering thresholds as a fundamental element in a warning system dedicated to the safeguarding of population in landslide-prone areas is discussed. In detail an operating procedure which is presently being verified and tested in the studied area is described. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In six independent multiyear simulations of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM3) coupled to the NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM 1.0), the Mississippi River Basin stands out as a region in which surface air temperature is, during summer months, negatively correlated with soil water and precipitation. To determine if these correlations represent, in part, a land surface feedback in which wet soils caused by high rates of precipitation lead to higher latent heat fluxes, creating a cooler, moister atmosphere, and vice versa, several experiments in which soil water was initialized to either wet (saturated) or dry (wilting point) were performed. In an ensemble of five wet and five dry 60-day simulations for summer conditions, initially wet soils resulted in cold surface air temperature compared to initially dry soils. Latent heat flux increased and sensible heat flux decreased in the wet experiment compared to the dry experiment only for the first 30 days even though the surface was colder and wetter than the dry experiment throughout the full 60 days. Precipitation increased for the initially wet soils compared to the dry soils over much of the Mississippi River Basin, but only during the first 30 days. This increase was small, and most of the increased flux of water into the atmosphere was advected out of the region. The magnitude of the wet-dry signal depended on the manner in which soil water limited evapotranspiration. A step-function response, in which soil water did not limit evapotranspiration until near wilting point, produced a stronger signal than a linear ramping function scaled between field capacity and wilting point. These results suggest that soil moisture feedbacks amplify the severity and persistence of floods and droughts and that the manner in which soil water limits evapotranspiration, which is poorly understood, is a key control of this response.},

abstract = {Simple hydraulic models for outflow of groundwater into a stream suggest that the form of the storage–discharge relationship for groundwater changes from linear, for a confined aquifer, to quadratic, for an unconfined flow. Tests of the form of stream flow recessions in 11 streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments the storage–discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage–discharge relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another, attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An extension of the linear model to ‘leaky' catchments, where the recession reaches zero flow, has been tested on two data sets. The second part of the paper deals with algorithms for baseflow during surface runoff events—the problem of hydrograph separation. Algorithms with one, two and three parameters have been compared, using data for the same 11 streams, and the results show significant differences in the baseflow index (BFI) predicted for some catchments. The two-parameter algorithm, which is fitted subjectively, is more consistent in providing plausible results than either the one- or three-parameter algorithms, both of which can be fitted objectively.},

abstract = {Soil moisture memory (SMM) is not only important for atmospheric weather/climate forecasting, but may also be useful in flood and drought prediction. Despite their importance, SMM studies are restricted in certain regions due to the scarcity of soil moisture data. To overcome this limitation, this study explains the variability of SMM in wet and dry basins, and shows an alternative way to predict the basin scale SMM using observed precipitation and potential evapotranspiration information only. This study presents the basin average SMM in the form of a timescale that indicates the duration of significant autocorrelations at 95{\%} confidence intervals. The soil moisture autocorrelations were calculated using observed precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, streamflow and soil moisture data sets simulated using the XinAnJiang (XAJ) model, for 26 river basins across the USA. The XAJ model's capability to simulate seasonal cycles (temporal anomalies) of soil moisture was validated against cycles from the observed data set of the Spoon River basin of Illinois State, USA. Based on the validation experience, the XAJ model was thereafter used to simulate soil moisture data for the analysed basins.Basin scale SMM timescale ranges were computed from 11 to 133days. The SMM timescale is highly influenced by precipitation variability and exhibits strong seasonality. Dry basins tend to show the highest memory during the winter months (December to February) and lowest in late spring (May). In contrast, wet basins have the lowest memory during winter and early spring (December to April) and highest in the late summer and early autumn (July to September). The SMM timescale displayed an exponential relationship with the basin aridity index, with an r2 value of 0.9. This relationship could be a cheap source of basin scale SMM prediction from widely available observed data sets (actual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration), and thus, could afford some knowledge of SMM under no knowledge conditions.},

abstract = {An objective common to many watershed studies is to separate storm hydrographs into two components: water that was present in the watershed prior to a storm event (soil moisture and groundwater) and water which fell on the watershed during the storm. To use this approach, a number of assumptions must be made including that the composition of water in the soil moisture and groundwater reservoirs are constant and known. The objective of this paper is to show that in settings where flow and transport are dominated by preferential pathways for flow, steady state mass balance calculations for quantitative hydrograph separation may be in error. We present field data from a site where flow and transport are dominated by preferential pathways (relict fractures in saprolite of sedimentary rocks) which indicate that the ??18O content of the water in the unsaturated and shallow saturated zones is not constant over the course of a storm event. We use a numerical model to further explore the interactions between the fractures and surrounding matrix. Both the field data and modeling results indicate that the ??18O of the previous storm event(s) has a strong influence on water in the fractures. On the time scale of a storm event, only the water in the matrix immediately surrounding the fracture mixes with water in the fracture, while the bulk of the matrix is isolated from fracture flow. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the ??18O in the subsurface and the isolation of the most of the matrix water from flow in fractures make the measurement of a singular ??18O value for subsurface reservoirs problematic and the assumption of a constant value doubtful. Since most near-surface geologic materials have preferential flow paths, we suggest that quantitative hydrograph separation using mass balance techniques is not possible in most situations. Future field and modeling investigations using the approach outlined here could be designed to explore the important temporal and spatial scales of variability in watersheds, and lead to a more quantitative approach to storm hydrograph separation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {By the analysis of the observed time series of streamflow from catchments, the main components of the underlying groundwater balance, namely, discharge, evapotranspiration loss, storage and recharge, can be identified and quantified. This holistic (as opposed to reductionist) estimation method is demonstrated for the Harris River catchment in southwest Western Australia. The relationship between the groundwater discharge and the reservoir storage of shallow unconfined aquifers was found to be nonlinear based on the analysis of numerous streamflow recession curves. However, depletion of groundwater by evapotranspiration losses, through the water uptake of tree roots, was found to bias the recession curves and the estimated reservoir parameters. As a result of the seasonality of both rainfall and potential evaporation, analysis of the recession curves, stratified according to time of the year, allowed the quantification of evapotranspiration loss as a function of calendar month and stored groundwater storage. Time series of recharge to the groundwater aquifer were computed from the observed total streamflows, and the estimated discharge and evapotranspiration losses, by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. Using traditional unit hydrograph methods unit recharge responses to rainfall were computed by least squares fitting. The shapes of the estimated unit response functions showed no significant seasonal variation.},

abstract = {Baseflow is often regarded as the streamflow component derived predominantly from groundwater discharge. The estimation of baseflow is important for water supply, water allocation, investigation of contamination impacts, low flow hydrology and flood hydrology. Baseflow is commonly estimated using graphical methods, recursive digital filters (RDFs), tracer based methods, and conceptual models. Of all of these methods, RDFs are the most commonly used, due to their relatively easy and efficient implementation. This paper presents a generic framework for assessing and improving the performance of RDFs for baseflow estimation for catchments with different characteristics and subject to different hydrological conditions. As part of the framework, a fully integrated surface water/groundwater (SW/GW) model is used to obtain estimates of streamflow and baseflow for catchments with different properties, such as soil types and rainfall patterns. An RDF is then applied to the simulated streamflow to assess how well the baseflow obtained using the filter matches the baseflow obtained using the fully integrated SW/GW model. In order to improve the performance of the filter, the user-defined parameter(s) controlling filter operation can be adjusted in order to obtain the best match between the baseflow obtained using the filter and that obtained using the fully integrated SW/GW model (i.e. through calibration). The proposed framework is tested by applying it to a common SW/GW benchmarking problem, the tilted V-catchment, for a range of soil properties. HydroGeoSphere (HGS) is used to develop the fully integrated SW/GW model and the Lyne and Hollick (LH) filter is used as the RDF. The performance of the LH filter is assessed using the commonly used value of the filter parameter of 0.925, as well as calibrated filter parameter values. The results obtained show that the performance of the LH filter is affected significantly by the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of the soil and that calibrated LH filter parameter can result in significant improvements in filter performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, the sensitivity of the atmosphere to groundwater table dynamics induced heterogeneity in land surface processes is examined under convective conditions. A fully coupled subsurface-land surface-atmosphere model is applied over a 150×150 km study area located in Western Germany and ensemble simulations are performed over two convective precipitation events considering two separate model configurations based on groundwater table dynamics. Ensembles are generated by varying the model atmospheric initial conditions following the prescribed ensemble generation method by the German Weather Service in order to account for the intrinsic, internal atmospheric variability. The results demonstrate that especially under strong convective conditions, groundwater table dynamics affect atmospheric boundary layer height, convective available potential energy, and precipitation via the coupling with land surface soil moisture and energy fluxes. Thus, this study suggests that systematic uncertainties may be introduced to atmospheric simulations if groundwater table dynamics are neglected in the model.},

abstract = {Transfer of atmospheric N deposition on shallow-soil forested basins on the Canadian Shield to receiving water bodies may be enhanced by rapid preferential dow along the soil-bedrock interface (BR runoff) on basin slopes. Controls on BR runoff, partitioning of event and pre-event water contributions to this how, and implications of this partitioning for N fluxes in BR runoff were studied under natural and artificial inputs to an instrumented slope. BR runoff as a fraction of water inputs to the slope increased with antecedent soil wetness and input depth. Event water contributions to BR runoff initially increased with antecedent soil wetness, but then declined at large antecedent soil wetness, Export of applied NH4+ from the slope was maximized when event water contributions containing large NH4+ concentrations dominated BR runoff; however, there was no relationship between the fraction of NO3- application transported in BR runoff and either application input or the event mater fraction of that runoff. The applicability of our results to other shallow-soil areas of the Canadian Shield is limited by artificial N inputs to the slope in excess of natural loads and by low rates of N mineralization and negligible nitrification in the slope's soils. Nevertheless, the study reinforces the need to consider how the hydrologic, geometric and pedologic properties of forest slopes interact with biotic and abiotic soil processes to control N transport and transformation.

Results from an existing automated digital filter technique for separating baseflow from daily streamflow records were compared to baseflow estimates made in the six water balance studies. Previous validation of automated baseflow separation techniques consisted only of comparisons with manual techniques. In this study, the automated digital filter technique was found to compare well with measured field estimates yielding a monthly coefficient of determination of 0.86. The recharge algorithm developed in this study is an automated derivation of the Rorabaugh hydrograph recession curve displacement method that utilizes daily streamflow. Comparison of annual recharge from field water balance measurements to those computed with the automated recession curve displacement method had coefficients of determination of 0.76 and predictive efficiencies of 71 percent. Monthly estimates showed more variation and are not advocated for use with this method. These techniques appear to be fast, reproducible methods for estimating baseflow and annual recharge and should be useful in regional modeling efforts and as a quick check on mass balance techniques for shallow water table aquifers.},

abstract = {Despite increasing awareness about the importance of low flows and droughts, spatial and temporal variations in the quantity and quality of baseflow generated in larger catchments are poorly constrained. Here, tracers are used in conjunction with hydrometric analysis to examine the sources of baseflow in the 1849 km2 catchment of the River Dee in Scotland. Geochemical tracers showed that the chemical composition of baseflow evolved downstream, but mainly reflected the dominance of sources in montane tributaries in the upper catchment. These findings were corroborated by hydrometric analysis which showed that the upper 54{\%} of the catchment contributed 71{\%} of baseflow in the lower river. Baseflows in smaller ({\textless}10 km2) headwater sub-catchments exhibited highly variable hydrochemical characteristics which were averaged at larger scales. Analysis of ??18O implies that well-mixed groundwater sources with similar isotopic signatures dominated baseflow generation throughout most of the catchment, probably indicating that groundwater in the lower slopes of montane headwaters provide a major source of baseflow. Periods of baseflow were found to be dynamic; despite the river system being in overall recession, the channel network exhibited contrasting responses to relatively small ({\textless}10 mm) isolated rainfall events in different parts of the catchment. Moreover, diurnal variation in flows in sub-catchments with a high proportion of coverage by peat soils is apparent, which may reflect the daily variation of evapotranspiration as a control on baseflow. Although a relatively stable period in the hydrological year, baseflows in larger catchments result from a complex suite of distributed hydrological processes. Further research is needed to understand how baseflows sustain water supplies and aquatic ecosystems, if managers are to be able to protect these catchment services from environmental change. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Baseflow separation and recession analysis have been two of the main tools for understanding runoff generation in catchments, but there are many different methods for each and no consensus on how best to apply them. A new baseflow separation method is presented, which is justified by being based generally on the more objective tracer separation methods and by being optimised by fitting to the recession hydrograph. Using this baseflow separation method, the thesis is advanced that recession analysis should be applied to the separated components (quickflow and baseflow), because of their very different origins and characteristics, rather than to the streamflow itself because analysing the latter alone gives misleading results. Applying baseflow separation before recession analysis sheds new light on water storage in catchments and may resolve some current prob- lems with recession analysis. It may also have implications for rainfall–runoff modelling. Among other things it shows that both quickflow and baseflow reservoirs have non- linear (quadratic) characteristics in the studied catchment (Glendhu, New Zealand).},

The event scale analysis shows that the timing-related parameters (i.e. durations of rainfall and flow events and time lag between rainfall to flow events) increase with basin area in terms of magnitude and variability. Similar dependence on basin scale is shown for the water balance-related parameters determined from this analysis, namely event rainfall and baseflow volumes and baseflow index.

abstract = {The study of baseflow in mountainous areas of basin headwaters, where the characteristics of the often fractured materials are very different to the standard issues concerning porous material applied in conventional hydrogeology, is an essential element in the characterization and quantification of water system resources. Their analysis through recession fragments provides information on the type of response of the sub-surface and subterranean systems and on the average relation between the storage and discharge of aquifers, starting from the joining of these fragments into a single curve, the Master Recession Curve (MRC). This paper presents the generation of the downward MRC over fragments selected after a preliminary analysis of the recession curves, using a hydrological model as the methodology for the identification and the characterization of quick sub-surface flows flowing through fractured materials. The hydrological calculation has identified recession fragments through surface runoff or snowmelt and those periods of intense evapotranspiration. The proposed methodology has been applied to three sub-basins belonging to a high altitude mountain basin in the Mediterranean area, with snow present every year, and their results were compared with those for the upward concatenation of the recession fragments. The results show the existence of two different responses, one quick (at the sub-surface, through the fractured material) and the other slow, with linear behaviour which takes place in periods of 10 and 17 days respectively and which is linked to the dimensions of the sub-basin. In addition, recesses belonging to the dry season have been selected in order to compare and validate the results corresponding to the study of recession fragments. The comparison, using these two methodologies, which differ in the time period selected, has allowed us to validate the results obtained for the slow flow.},

Nevertheless, the ability to generalize these findings to ungauged regions remains out of reach. In spite of their apparent physical basis and complexity, the current generation of detailed models is process weak. Their representations of the internal states and process dynamics are still at odds with many experimental findings. In order to make continued progress in watershed hydrology and to bring greater coherence to the science, we need to move beyond the status quo of having to explicitly characterize or prescribe landscape heterogeneity in our (highly calibrated) models and in this way reproduce process complexity and instead explore the set of organizing principles that might underlie the heterogeneity and complexity.

Baseflow separation and recession analysis have been two of the main tools for understanding runoff generation in catchments, but there are many different methods for each. The new baseflow separation method presented here (the bump and rise method or BRM) aims to accurately simulate the shape of tracer-determined baseflow or pre-event water. Application of the method by calibrating its parameters, using (a) tracer data or (b) an optimising method, is demonstrated for the Glendhu Catchment, New Zealand. The calibrated BRM algorithm is then applied to the Glendhu streamflow record. The new recession approach advances the thesis that recession analysis of streamflow alone gives misleading information on catchment storage reservoirs because streamflow is a varying mixture of components of very different origins and characteristics (at the simplest level, quickflow and baseflow as identified by the BRM method). Recession analyses of quickflow, baseflow and streamflow show that the steep power-law slopes often observed for streamflow at intermediate flows are artefacts due to mixing and are not representative of catchment reservoirs. Applying baseflow separation before recession analysis could therefore shed new light on water storage reservoirs in catchments and possibly resolve some current problems with recession analysis. Among other things it shows that both quickflow and baseflow reservoirs in the studied catchment have (non-linear) quadratic characteristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

All these aspects are synthesized and exemplified in this overview. In addition, the mechanisms of interactions between groundwater and surface water (GW–SW) as they affect recharge–discharge processes are comprehensively outlined, and the ecological significance and the human impacts of such interactions are emphasized. Surface-water and groundwater ecosystems are viewed as linked components of a hydrologic continuum leading to related sustainability issues. This overview concludes with a discussion of research needs and challenges facing this evolving field. The biogeochemical processes within the upper few centimeters of sediments beneath nearly all surface-water bodies (hyporheic zone) have a profound effect on the chemistry of the water interchange, and here is where most of the recent research has been focusing. However, to advance conceptual and other modeling of GW–SW systems, a broader perspective of such interactions across and between surface-water bodies is needed, including multidimensional analyses, interface hydraulic characterization and spatial variability, site-to-region regionalization approaches, as well as cross-disciplinary collaborations.},

Individually characterizing streamflow recessions often involves describing the similarities and differences between model parameters fitted to each recession time series. Significant methodological sensitivity has been identified in the fitting and parameterization of models that describe populations of many recessions, but the dependence of estimated model parameters on methodological choices has not been evaluated for event-by-event forms of analysis. Here, we use daily streamflow data from 16 catchments in northern California and southern Oregon to investigate how combinations of commonly used streamflow recession definitions and fitting techniques impact parameter estimates of a widely-used power-law recession model. We show that: (i) methodological decisions, including ones that have received little attention in the literature, can impact parameter value estimates and model goodness-of-fit; (ii) the central tendencies of event-scale recession parameter probability distributions are largely robust to methodological choices, in the sense that differing methods rank catchments similarly according to the medians of these distributions; (iii) recession parameter distributions are method-dependent, but roughly catchment-independent, such that changing the choices made about a particular method affects a given parameter in similar ways across most catchments; and (iv) the observed correlative relationship between the power law recession scale parameter and catchment antecedent wetness varies depending on recession definition and fitting choices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These rivers deliver {\~{}}340.9km3yr-1 of freshwater to the Caribbean Sea. The largest freshwater supply is provided by the Magdalena River, with a mean discharge of 205.1km3yr-1 at Calamar, which is 26{\%} of the total fluvial discharge into this basin. From 2000 to 2010, the annual streamflow of these rivers increased as high as 65{\%}, and upward trends in statistical significance were found for the Mulatos, Canal del Dique, Magdalena, and Fundaci{\'{o}}n Rivers. The concurrence of major oscillation processes and the maximum power of the 3-7year band fluctuation defined a period of intense hydrological activity from approximately 1998-2002. The wavelet spectrum highlighted a change in the variability patterns of fluvial systems between 2000 and 2010 characterised by a shift towards a quasi-decadal process (8-12years) domain. The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), El Ni{\~{n}}o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and quasi-decadal climate processes are the main factors controlling the fluvial discharge variability of these fluvial systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Summary Precipitation on the subtropical Andes in northwestern Argentina is the main source of freshwater to rivers, which provide water for consumption, hydroelectric generation and irrigation of agricultural fields. Regional streamflow records for the past 60 years indicate a period of enhanced inter-annual and inter-decadal variability during recent decades. Here we present a long-term perspective of streamflow variations for R{\'{i}}o Bermejo, a major river in the subtropics of Argentina–Bolivia. This streamflow reconstruction covers the period 1680–2001 and was performed using principal component regression models based on precipitation sensitive tree-ring width series. Composite tree-ring chronologies from Juglans australis, Cedrela lilloi and Schinopsis lorentzii were used as predictors to reconstruct the May–October (dry season) streamflow variations. Monthly instrumental streamflow records were used to assess the temporal relationship between climatic data and tree-ring records. The regression model explains 52{\%} of the variance of May–October Bermejo discharge (R2 adj = 0.499) over the period 1941–1992. Analyses of the frequency, intensity and duration of pluvials and droughts indicates a sustained increase in streamflow since the 1960s, which is exceptional since 1680. Pearson's correlation coefficients between R{\'{i}}o Bermejo records against gridded interpolated precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation indicate that the South American monsoon is the main source of regional precipitation and the consequent discharge of subtropical rivers in northern Argentina. Long-term streamflow reconstructions in subtropical South America contribute to our understanding of past and present climate variations and the related large-scale atmospheric features that drive these variations.},

@article{Tootle2008,
abstract = {An evaluation of Pacific and Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and Colombian streamflow was performed to identify coupled regions of SST and Colombian streamflow variability. Applying the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) statistical method, SSTs (and Colombian streamflow for 10 stations) were evaluated for (a) the Pacific Ocean, (b) the Atlantic Ocean, and (c) the combined Pacific and Atlantic Ocean for a 41 year period of record (1960-2000). A lead-time approach was adopted such that spring-summer seasonal (April through September) SSTs were evaluated with streamflow for the following calendar-year (January through December). The El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been acknowledged in previous research efforts as an influence of Colombian streamflow. The ENSO signal identified that warmer (cooler) equatorial SSTs resulted in lesser (greater) streamflow. In general, the use of predefined published indices, such as ENSO, is appealing for water managers and forecasters. However, the utilization of SSTs for entire regions (Pacific and Atlantic Oceans) eliminates any spatial bias as to which oceanic SST region (or regions) impact hydrology. This will assist in the identification of regions that may not be represented in existing indices and could lead to improved forecasting. The SVD 1st temporal expansion series of Pacific (and the combined Pacific and Atlantic) Ocean SSTs and streamflow for several stations resulted in correlation values greater than that of well known climate indices (e.g., ENSO), which could result in improved streamflow predictability. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Tarboton1989a,
abstract = {This work examines patterns of regularity and scale in landform and channel networks. Digital elevation model data sets from throughout the United States are used as a data source. First we consider the two-dimensional planform properties of channel networks. We find that networks as a whole may be regarded as space filling fractals, ie.., with fractal dimension 2. The scaling may be described by Horton's laws and provides a link between Horton length and bifurcation ratios. Second we focus on elevation where the mean slope of rivers is characterized by a power law scaling with area. Investigations have recently used this to suggest that channel slopes are self-similar with magnitude or area as a scaling index. Our data indicates otherwise; in particular the variance of channel slope is larger than that predicted by simple self-similarity. The coefficient of variation of link slopes increases with area contributing to the link. This suggests multi-scaling. The scaling exponent for the standard deviation is approximately half the corresponding exponent in the relationship of the slope mean to magnitude or area. A model for channel slopes based on a point process of elevation drops along the channel is suggested. This model reproduces the observed multi-scaling properties when the density of elevation increments is related to area (or magnitude) as A- 0. This scaling cannot hold in the limit of small area and must break at some point. We suggest that this break defines the lower bound scale for which channels exist and can therefore be used to determine the drainage density, the basic horizontal length scale associated with the dissection of the landscape by the channel network. This break in scale can also be detected as a break in the constant drop property, namely the empirical fact that the elevation drop along Strahler streams is on average constant. That the break in scale gives drainage density is justified using a stability analysis of landform development processes and empirical comparison of drainage densities from many DEM data sets. This work provides a rational way to extract channel networks with physically justifiable drainage density from digital elevation models.},

abstract = {Artifact depressions in digital elevation models (DEMs) interrupt flow paths and alter drainage directions. Techniques for removing depressions should enforce continuous flow paths in a way that requires the leastmodification of the DEM. Impacts on the spatial and statistical distributions of elevation and its derivatives were assessed for four methods of removing depressions: (1) filling; (2) breaching; (3) a combination of filling and breaching, with breaching constrained to a maximum of two grid cells; (4) a combination of filling and breaching based on an impact reduction approach (IRA). The IRA removes each depression using either filling or breaching, depending on which method has the least impact, in terms of the number of modified cells and the mean absolute difference in the DEM. Analysis of a LiDAR DEM of a landscape on the Canadian Shield showed significant differences in the impacts among the four depression removal methods. Depression filling, a removal method that is widely implemented in geographical information system software, was found to impact terrain attributes most severely. Constrained breaching, which relies heavily on filling for larger depressions, also performed poorly. Both depression breaching and the IRA impacted spatial and statistical distributions of terrain attributes less than depression filling and constrained breaching. The most sensitive landscapes to depression removal were those that contained large (i.e. {\textgreater}10{\%}) flat areas, because of the occurrence of relatively large depressions in these areas.

abstract = {A high-resolution and high-accuracy drainage network map is a prerequisite for simulating the water cycle in land surface hydrological models. The objective of this study was to develop a new automated extraction of drainage network model, which can get high-precision continuous drainage network on high-resolution DEM (Digital Elevation Model). The high-resolution DEM need too much computer resources to extract drainage network. The conventional GIS method often can not complete to calculate on high-resolution DEM of big basins, because the number of grids is too large. In order to decrease the computation time, an advanced distributed automated extraction of drainage network model (Adam) was proposed in the study. The Adam model has two features: (1) searching upward from outlet of basin instead of sink filling, (2) dividing sub-basins on low-resolution DEM, and then extracting drainage network on sub-basins of high-resolution DEM. The case study used elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) at 3 arc-second resolution in Zhujiang River basin, China. The results show Adam model can dramatically reduce the computation time. The extracting drainage network was continuous and more accurate than HydroSHEDS (Hydrological data and maps based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales).},

abstract = {Identification and removal of surface depressions is a critical step for automated modelling of surface rainfall runoff based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). At present, nearly all GIS and hydrologic software packages employ Jenson and Domingue's method for preparing depressionless DEMs for hydrologic analysis. This conventional method is computationally intensive and time-consuming. With the growing availability of high-resolution DEMs produced by airborne LIDAR and InSAR techniques, GIS-based hydrologic applications often need to handle larger geographic areas at finer resolutions. In the face of high-resolution DEMs, the conventional method becomes inadequate and deficient. In this paper, we present a new method for efficiently identifying and filling surface depressions in DEMs. This method can simultaneously determine flow paths and spatial partition of watersheds with one pass of processing. A novel concept of spill elevation and the least-cost search for optimal flow paths are the two cornerstones of our method. The time complexity of our method is in O(Nlog N). It has been implemented using C+ + programming language and successfully applied to USGS DEMs and LIDAR DEMs of various sizes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the conventional method by a factor of over 30, in terms of running time},

The original DEM and these three derivative data sets can then be processed in a variety of ways to optionally delineate drainage networks, overland paths, watersheds for user-specified locations, sub-watersheds for the major tributaries of a drainage network, or pour point linkages between watersheds. The computer-generated drainage lines and watershed polygons and the pour point linkage information can be transferred to vector-based geographic information systems for further analysis.

The models selected for integration are loosely coupled, structured upon a common GIS platform that facilitates data exchange. The hydrologic model HEC-HMS is calibrated for a specific storm event that occurred within central Washington State. The land-use forecasting model, What If? is implemented to forecast future spatial distributions of low-density residential land-uses under low and high population growth estimates. Forecasted land-use distribution patterns for the years 2015, 2025, and 2050 are then used as land-use data input for the calibrated hydrologic model, keeping all other parameters constant. Impacts to the stream discharge hydrograph are predicted as the study area becomes increasingly developed as forecasted by What If?. The initial results of this integration process demonstrate the synergy that can be generated through the linkage of the selected models. The ability to quantifiably forecast the potential hydrologic implications of proposed land-use policies before their implementation offers land-use decision-makers a valuable tool for discerning which proposed land-use alternatives will be effective at minimizing storm water runoff.},

abstract = {Field studies in watershed hydrology continue to characterize and catalogue the enormous heterogeneity and complexity of rainfall runoff processes in more and more watersheds, in different hydroclimatic regimes, and at different scales. Nevertheless, the ability to generalize these findings to ungauged regions remains out of reach. In spite of their apparent physical basis and complexity, the current generation of detailed models is process weak. Their representations of the internal states and process dynamics are still at odds with many experimental findings. In order to make continued progress in watershed hydrology and to bring greater coherence to the science, we need to move beyond the status quo of having to explicitly characterize or prescribe landscape heterogeneity in our (highly calibrated) models and in this way reproduce process complexity and instead explore the set of organizing principles that might underlie the heterogeneity and complexity. This commentary addresses a number of related new avenues for research in watershed science, including the use of comparative analysis, classification, optimality principles, and network theory, all with the intent of defining, understanding, and predicting watershed function and enunciating important watershed functional traits.},

abstract = {Flash flooding is one of the most costly and deadly natural hazards in the United States and across the globe. This study advances the use of high-resolution quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) for flash flood forecasting. The QPFs are derived from a stormscale ensemble prediction system, and used within a distributed hydrological model framework to yield basin-specific, probabilistic flash flood forecasts (PFFFs). Before creating the PFFFs, it is important to characterize QPF uncertainty, particularly in terms of location which is the most problematic for hydrological use of QPFs. The SAL methodology (Wernli et al., 2008), which stands for structure, amplitude, and location, is used for this error quantification, with a focus on location. Finally, the PFFF methodology is proposed that produces probabilistic hydrological forecasts. The main advantages of this method are: (1) identifying specific basin scales that are forecast to be impacted by flash flooding; (2) yielding probabilistic information about the forecast hydrologic response that accounts for the locational uncertainties of the QPFs; (3) improving lead time by using stormscale NWP ensemble forecasts; and (4) not requiring multiple simulations, which are computationally demanding.},

abstract = {The analysis of Henderson and Wooding, 1964, is expanded in comparing simplified models of subsurface stormflow for the case of a sloping soil mantle in which the hydraulic conductivity is constant throughout. Reviewing studies both in the field and theoretical in nature, the process of subsurface stormflow apparently will be the dominant mode of hydrological response of a hillslope or catchment under the following conditions: soils of high permeability, whether inherent in the soil matrix or due to structural or biotic macropores; and a steep hydraulic gradient, whether due to the slope of hillslopes or to the buildup of groundwater mounds on shallow slopes. The magnitude and timing of the subsurface flow response will depend on the depth and hydraulic conditions of the unsaturated zone at the time of the storm. In this paper only the simplest possible conditions have been studied, with the unsaturated zone being neglected, and constant input to a soil of constant hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity throughout its depth being assumed. It has been shown using data from field and numerical studies of subsurface stormflow that the kinematic approximation may be appropriate for combinations of slope conditions and input rates of practical interest.

They are easy-to-use, simple-to-design, and capable of targeting multiple loci simultaneously. Given that cancer develops from cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations, CRISPR-Cas9 and its variants (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-Cas9 systems) hold extensive application potentials in cancer modeling and therapy. To date, they have already been applied to model oncogenic mutations in cell lines1 and in adult animals2 , as well as to combat cancer by disabling oncogenic viruses3 or by manipulating cancer genome4 . Given the importance of epigenome and transcriptome in tumorigenesis, manipulation of cancer epigenome and transcriptome for cancer modeling and therapy is a promising area in the future. Whereas (epi)genetic modifications of cancer microenvironment with CRISPR-Cas9 systems for therapeutic purposes represent another promising area in cancer research. Herein, we introduce the functions and mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in genome editing and epigenome modulation, retrospect their applications in cancer modelling and therapy, discuss limitations and possible solutions, and propose future directions, in hope of providing concise and enlightening information for readers interested in this area.

abstract = {The management of flash flood hazards and risks is a critical component of public safety and quality of life. Flash-floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems are not able to monitor for rainfall and river discharge. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrological generating mechanisms of flash-floods are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain forecasts of these events. The objective of the HYDRATE project has been to improve the scientific basis of flash flood forecasting by advancing and harmonising a European-wide innovative flash flood observation strategy and developing a coherent set of technologies and tools for effective early warning systems. To this end, the project included actions on the organization of the existing flash flood data patrimony across Europe. The final aim of HYDRATE was to enhance the capability of flash flood forecasting in ungauged basins by exploiting the extended availability of flash flood data and the improved process understanding. This paper provides a review of the work conducted in HYDRATE with a special emphasis on how this body of research can contribute to guide the policy-life cycle concerning flash flood risk management. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the analysis of the 1 October 2009 flash flood and debris flow event caused by a very intense rainfall concentrated over the Messina area. The storm caused severe flash floods in many villages around the city of Messina, such as Giampilieri, Scaletta Zanclea, Altolia Superiore and Molino, with 38 casualties and significant damages to property, buildings, roads and bridges estimated close to 550 million Euro. The main focus of this work is to perform a post event analysis, putting together available meteorological and hydrological data in order to get better insight into temporal and spatial variability of the rain storm, the soil moisture conditions and the consequent flash flood in the Giampilieri catchment. The event was investigated using observed data from a raingauge network. Statistical analysis using GEV distribution was performed and rainfall return period (storm severity) was estimated. Further, measured rainfall data and rainfall-runoff modelling were used to estimate soil moisture conditions, to analyse the hydrological behaviour and to reconstruct flood hydrograph. With the help of GIS technology and particularly spatial analysis, the volume of debris which has gone down into the Giampilieri village was also calculated. GIS maps with landslide and material deposit areas were produced and analysed.},

The ERS Scatterometer is a C-band radar with a spatial resolution of 50 km and a high temporal sampling rate. An algorithm for estimating the surface soil moisture content is applied to 6 years of data. A qualitative comparison with meteorological observations and auxiliary information indicates that good-quality surface wetness values can be determined. A simple method is developed to relate the surface estimates with the profile soil moisture content. This model requires as input the remotely sensed radar data and soil data encompassing wilting level, field capacity, and porosity. The method was validated with an extensive data set of gravimetric soil moisture measurements in the 0-20 cm and 0-100 cm layers from the agrometeorological network in the Ukraine. It is found that the ERS Scatterometer data can be used to distinguish about five soil moisture levels with good confidence.},

abstract = {The availability of in situ measurements of precipitation in remote locations is limited. As a result, the use of satellite measurements of precipitation is attractive for water resources management. Combined precipitation products that rely partially or entirely on satellite measurements are becoming increasingly available. However, these products have several weaknesses, for example their failure to capture certain types of precipitation, limited accuracy and limited spatial and temporal resolution. This paper evaluates the usefulness of several commonly used precipitation products over data scarce, complex mountainous terrain from a water resources perspective. Spatially averaged precipitation time series were generated or obtained for 16 sub-basins of the Paute river basin in the Ecuadorian Andes and 13 sub-basins of the Baker river basin in Chilean Patagonia. Precipitation time series were generated using the European Centre for Medium Weather Range Forecasting (ECMWF) 40year reanalysis (ERA-40) and the subsequent ERA-interim products, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset 1 (NCEP R1) hindcast products, as well as precipitation estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN). The Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B42 is also used for the Ecuadorian Andes. These datasets were compared to both spatially averaged gauged precipitation and river discharge. In general, the time series of the remotely sensed and hindcast products show a low correlation with locally observed precipitation data. Large biases are also observed between the different products. Hydrological verification based on river flows reveals that water balance errors can be extremely high for all evaluated products, including interpolated local data, in basins smaller than 1000km2. The observations are consistent over the two study regions despite very different climatic settings and hydrological processes, which is encouraging for extrapolation to other mountainous regions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A physically based distributed slope stability model is described that utilizes a combined surface–subsurface kinematic wave module to assess groundwater fluctuations related to slope stability. A total of 82 major rainstorms from 1972 to 1990 in Carnation Creek, British Columbia, were examined to determine the influence of different characteristics of rainstorms (such as mean and maximum hourly intensity, duration, and rainfall amount) on the slope stability. These rainstorms vary in mean intensity from 1{\textperiodcentered}6 to 11{\textperiodcentered}2 mm h−1, storm duration from 11 to 93 h, and maximum hourly intensity from 3{\textperiodcentered}4 to 35 mm h−1. Four synthetic ‘uniform intensity' rainstorms were also tested against real storms to assess the effect of short-term hourly rainfall intensity peaks on landslide occurrence. Altogether, 602 simulations were conducted. The combined influence of mean and maximum hourly intensity, duration, and total rainfall amount of rainstorms were important in generating landslides. The temporal distribution of short-term intensity also influenced the landslide occurrence. When saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil was lowered or soil depth was raised, most rainstorms produced larger numbers of landslides. For the most part, actual rainstorms produced less stable conditions than their synthetic ‘uniform intensity' counterparts. For all landslide-producing storms, slope failure usually occurred after some threshold of cumulative rainfall and maximum hourly rainfall intensity. These simulations provide insights into the distributed behaviour of landslide occurrence during large rainstorms with varying characteristics.

abstract = {Just as with the storms that cause them, flash floods are highly variable and non-linear phenomena in both time and space; hence understanding and anticipating the genesis of flash floods is far from straightforward. There is therefore a huge requirement for tools with the potential to provide advance warning of situations likely to lead to flash floods, and thus provide additional time for the flood forecasting services. The Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) method is used on US catchments to estimate the average number of inches of rainfall for given durations required to produce flash flooding. This rainfall amount is used afterwards as a flood warning threshold. In Europe, flash floods often occur on small catchments (approximately 100 km2) and it has already been shown that the spatial variability of rainfall has a great impact on the catchment response (Le Lay and Saulnier, 2007). Therefore, in this study, an improved FFG method which accounts for rainfall spatial variability is proposed. The objectives of this paper are (i) to assess the FFG method applicability on French Mediterranean catchments with a distributed process-oriented hydrological model and (ii) to assess the effect of the rainfall spatial variability on this method. The results confirm the influence of the spatial variability of rainfall events in relation with its interaction with soil properties.},

abstract = {Floods, landslides and debris flows are natural events that occur all over the world and are often induced by extreme rainfall conditions. Several extreme events occurred in Slovenia (Europe) in the last 25. years that caused 18 casualties and approximately 500. million Euros of economic loss. The intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationship was constructed using the Frank copula function for several rainfall stations using high-resolution rainfall data with an average subsample length of 34. years. The empirical rainfall threshold curves were also evaluated for selected extreme events. Post-event analyses showed that rainfall characteristics triggering flash floods and landslides are different. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the inter-event time definition (IETD) and subsample definition methodology can have a significant influence on the position of rainfall events in the intensity-duration space, the constructed IDF curves and on the relationship between the empirical rainfall threshold curves and the IDF curves constructed using the copula approach. Furthermore, a combination of several empirical rainfall thresholds with an appropriate high-density rainfall measurement network can be used as part of the early warning system of the initiation of landslides and debris flows. However, different rainfall threshold curves should be used for lowland and mountainous areas in Slovenia.},

abstract = {Analysis of ensemble forecasting strategies, which can provide a tangible backing for flood early warning procedures and mitigation measures over the Mediterranean region, is one of the fundamental motivations of the international HyMeX programme. Here, we examine two severe hydrometeorological episodes that affected the Milano urban area and for which the complex flood protection system of the city did not completely succeed. Indeed, flood damage have exponentially increased during the last 60 years, due to industrial and urban developments. Thus, the improvement of the Milano flood control system needs a synergism between structural and non-structural approaches. First, we examine how land-use changes due to urban development have altered the hydrological response to intense rainfalls. Second, we test a flood forecasting system which comprises the Flash-flood Event-based Spatially distributed rainfall-runoff Transformation, including Water Balance (FEST-WB) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models. Accurate forecasts of deep moist convection and extreme precipitation are difficult to be predicted due to uncertainties arising from the numeric weather prediction (NWP) physical parameterizations and high sensitivity to misrepresentation of the atmospheric state; however, two hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPS) have been designed to explicitly cope with uncertainties in the initial and lateral boundary conditions (IC/LBCs) and physical parameterizations of the NWP model. No substantial differences in skill have been found between both ensemble strategies when considering an enhanced diversity of IC/LBCs for the perturbed initial conditions ensemble. Furthermore, no additional benefits have been found by considering more frequent LBCs in a mixed physics ensemble, as ensemble spread seems to be reduced. These findings could help to design the most appropriate ensemble strategies before these hydrometeorological extremes, given the computational cost of running such advanced HEPSs for operational purposes.},

abstract = {In this study, a regional distributed hydrological model is used to perform long-term and flash-flood event simulations, over the C{\'{e}}vennes–Vivarais region (south of France). The objective is to improve our understanding on the role played by geology on the hydrological processes of catchments during two past flash-flood events. This modelling work is based on Vannier et al. (“Regional estimation of catchment-scale soil properties by means of streamflow recession analysis for use in distributed hydrological models”, Hydrological Processes, 2014), where streamflow recessions are analysed to estimate the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of weathered rock layers, depending on the geological nature of catchments. Weathered rock layers are thus implemented into the hydrological model CVN-p, and the contribution of these layers is assessed during flash-flood events simulations as well as during inter-event periods. The model is used without any calibration, to test hypotheses on the active hydrological processes. The results point out two different hydrological behaviours, depending on the geology: on crystalline rocks (granite and gneiss), the addition of a weathered rock layer considerably improves the simulated discharges, during flash-flood events as well as during recession periods, and makes the model able to remarkably reproduce the observed streamflow dynamics. For other geologies (schists especially), the benefits are real, but not sufficient to properly simulate the observed streamflow dynamics. These results probably underline the existence of poorly known processes (flow paths, non-linear spilling process) associated with the planar structure of schisty rocks. On a methodological point of view, this study proposes a simple way to account for the additional storage associated with each geological entity, through the addition of a weathered porous rock layer situated below the traditionally-considered upper soil horizons, and shows its applicability and benefits for the simulation of flash flood events at the regional scale.},

abstract = {Implementation of flood warning systems and community self-help programs is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the flash-flood risk. Inmany instances, these are the only affordable and sustainable mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, flash-flood warning is still hampered by changes in societal needs and by our limited knowledge of atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of this type of flood. On the one hand, flood warning has traditionally focused on localized targets for the protection of communities and for the management of hydraulic reservoirs. Given the general development of dispersed urbanization and transportation, and the expansion of green tourism and water sports in mountainous regions, human lives and property are increasingly exposed to flash-flood hazard in a scatteredmanner. This means that every river section of a monitored region can be considered as a potential target for flood warning. On the other hand, our poor knowledge of this phenomenon comes from the fact that, in most flash-flood cases, the rain accumulations and the discharges are simply unknown over most of the watersheds of concern. Flash floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems of rain and discharge in rivers are not able to monitor. As these events are locally rare, they also escape the realm of field-based experimentation. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of flash floods are poorly understood. Progress in flash-flood research is hampered by three main prob- lems: (i) the downscaling problem due to the incoherent space and time scales between atmospheric models and the flash-flood trigger- ing processes; (ii) the ungauged basin problem due to the fact that the small basins prone to flash-floods are seldom gauged and must be modelled without calibration; and (iii) the problem of knowing the limits of the soil retention control of runoff under the range of rain accumulations considered. Our view is that weather radar net- works deeply modify the flash flood monitoring problem. Combin- ing radar detection of rain and distributed hydrological modelling shows considerable potential for improving both the understanding of fundamental scientific questions, including extreme storms and runoff production mechanisms, and the ‘distributed' monitoring of the flash-flood hazard. This short commentary addresses some of these developments and identifies some new research needs in radar hydrology.},

abstract = {Mesoscale convective cloud systems that produce large amounts of rain in mid-latitudes and most of the rain in the tropics consist of a combination of convective and stratiform cloud. The convective regions contain numerous deep cells that are often but not always arranged in Lines. The stratiform region is an outgrowth of the convective ensemble; it lies adjacent to the convective region and is seeded by ice particles detrained from convective towers. Sometimes it lies to the rear of a propagating convective line, while on other occasions it surrounds the convection. The heating of the large-scale environment by a mesoscale convective system is affected by both the convective and stratiform regions. Although processes such as melting and radiation are important, the net heating by a system is dominated by condensation and evaporation associated with vertical air motions. This paper reviews recent observational evidence regarding the mean vertical motion profiles in the convective and stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems and the implications of these mean motions for the vertical distribution of heating of the large-scale environment. In both the convective and the stratiform regions, vertical motions have been determined by various techniques, including composites of rawinsonde and aircraft wind data, single- and dual-Doppler precipitation radar analyses, and wind-profiler observations. In stratiform regions, these data consistently show mean vertical velocity that is upward in the upper troposphere and downward in the lower troposphere. The level separating upward from downward motion is located from 0 to 2 km above the 0°C level, depending on location within the stratiform region. Diagnostic calculations show that these vertical motion profiles imply heating of the upper troposphere and cooling of lower levels by stratiform-region processes. Data on vertical motions in the convective regions are less consistent from case to case. These data sometimes indicate that the mean vertical velocity in convective regions is maximum in the lower troposphere. In other cases, the data indicate a maximum in the high troposphere. Diagnostic calculations show that heating profiles diagnosed from these two types of profile are quite different, the first having a maximum of heating in the lower troposphere, while the second has a maximum in the middle troposphere. Although it is difficult to determine whether or not the differences in estimates arise from different types of observations, analysis methods or sampling strategies, it seems likely that they stem from differences in the large-scale environment of the different mesoscale systems. The ubiquitous occurrence of stratiform regions in mesoscale convective systems and hurricanes together with their consistent heating profiles, which systematically concentrate heating in upper levels while cooling lower levels, are a major consideration in evaluating the interaction of mesoscale systems with the large-scale environment. However, the consistency of the stratiform profiles from case to case indicates that the variability of net (convective plus stratiform) heating profiles from case to case ties primarily in the variation of the convective-region profiles from one case to another. It is suggested that future work should focus on the convective-region vertical profiles of vertical motion and heating and on the large-scale environmental factors that may control the variation of these profiles from case to case. 1.},

abstract = {Runoff estimation in ungauged catchments is probably one of the most basic and oldest tasks of hydrologists. This long-standing issue has received increased attention recently due to the PUB (Prediction in Ungauged Basins) initiative. Given the challenges of predicting runoff for ungauged catchments one might argue that the best course of action is to take a few runoff measurements. In this study we explored how implementing such a procedure might support predictions in an ungauged basin. We used a number of monitored Swedish catchments as hypothetical ungauged basins where we pretended to start with no runoff data and then added different sub-sets of the available data to constrain a simple catchment model. These sub-sets consisted of a limited number of single runoff measurements; in other words these data represent what could be measured with limited efforts in an ungauged basin. We used a Monte Carlo approach and predicted runoff as a weighted ensemble mean of simulations using acceptable parameter sets. We found that the ensemble prediction clearly outperformed the predictions using single parameter sets and that surprisingly little runoff data was necessary to identify model parameterizations that provided good results for the "ungauged" test periods. These results indicated that a few runoff measurements can contain much of the information content of continuous runoff time series. However, the study also indicated that results may differ significantly between catchments and also depend on the days chosen for taking the measurements.},

Dendrogeomorphology was used to date and reconstruct large-scale snow avalanche events that occurred in the last four decades. Dendrochronological analyses yielded the dates of nine winters when avalanches occurred in the recent past in six studied avalanche paths. Some of these avalanches were already known, but others had not been documented. In one case, the existing avalanche path map was improved with the dendrogeomorphological information of a larger past event. As a result of the dendrogeomorphological analyses, evidence for three regional-scale major avalanche years was identified in the SE Pyrenees from 1971 to 2004: 1971-1972, 1995-1996 and 2002-2003. The specific synoptic atmospheric situations and the most likely nivometeorological and snowpack conditions that released these major avalanches were determined using weather data for the seasons of major avalanche releases. In 1971-1972 the snow avalanche episode was characterized by a deep trough crossing the Pyrenees. In 1995-1996 a variety of meteorological situations produced several episodes of major avalanches. In 2002-2003 the more significant of two episodes was attributed to a north advection pumping an arctic air mass over the Pyrenees. The 1995-1996 avalanche season proved to be the most notable in the four past decades in the Pyrenees.},

abstract = {This contribution is one of the first studies about the regionalization of parameter sets for a rainfall-runoff model process-oriented and dedicated to flash floods. MARINE model performances are tested on a large database of 117 flash floods occurred during the last two decades in the French Mediterranean region. Given the scarcity of flash flood data, the dataset used in this study represents a large sample of hydrology and landscapes from Pyrenean, Mediterranean, C??vennes-Vivarais and Provence regions. Spatial proximity and similarity approaches with several combinations of descriptors are tested. Encouraging results are obtained with two similarity approaches based on physiographic descriptors with two and three donor catchments. There is only a small decrease of performance of 10{\%} from cal/val to regionalization for these two methods. For 13 catchments out of 16 there is at least one flood event simulated with rather good performance. This study highlights the importance of hydrological information that is available in calibration events for a gauged catchment and from donor catchment(s) for regionalization. Moreover it is found that regionalization is easier for catchments with an apparently more regular behaviour. The most sensitive parameter of MARINE model, C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}Z{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, controlling soil volume and water balance, is rather well constrained by the two similarity approaches thanks to bedrock descriptors.},

abstract = {The separation of storm hydrographs using stable isotope tracers dates back to the late 1960s. These studies ushered in a paradigm shift in how hydrologists conceptualized runoff generation as most showed a large preponderance of pre-event water in the storm hydrograph, even at peak flow. This forced a fundamental re-examination of the processes of water delivery to streams during rainfall and snowmelt events. Whilst the simplicity of the two-component hydrograph separation was a powerful tool for showing the importance of stored water effusion, the assumptions implicit in the two-component model have now become limiting for further advancement of the approach. Here we review the use of stable isotopes for hydrograph separation with particular reference to studies completed since the last comprehensive review of the subject in 1994. We review critically the contributions to new field knowledge gained by isotope hydrograph separation applications. We focus specifically on the current issues regarding the limitations of the two-component approach. We examine the role of soil water as a contributor to channel stormflow and the issues raised by differences in the soil water and groundwater signatures at the watershed scale. Finally, we offer ideas on how to overcome the limitations of the two-component approach and present a vision for future directions for isotope based hydrograph separation. These future directions are focused on high frequency analysis of rainfall-runoff structures and dual isotope analysis of catchment end-members including comparison of lysimeter-based soil water sampling of mobile soil water versus cryogenic and vapor-based analysis of tightly bound water. ?? 2013 .},

This is especially the case in the Mediterranean and oversea territories/departments of France, characterized by extreme hydro-climatological features and with a large part of the population exposed to flood risks. The recurrence of remarkable flash flood events, associated with high hazard intensity, significant damage and socio-political consequences, therefore raises several issues for authorities and risk management policies. This study aims to improve our understanding of the hazard analysis process in the case of four remarkable flood events: March 1930, October 1940, January 1980 and November 1999. Firstly, we present the methodology used to define the remarkability score of a flood event. Then, to identify the factors leading to a remarkable flood event, we explore the main parameters of the hazard analysis process, such as the meteorological triggering conditions, the return period of the rainfall and peak discharge, as well as some additional factors (initial catchment state, flood chronology, cascade effects, etc.). The results contribute to understanding the complexity of the processes leading to flood hazard and highlight the importance for risk managers of taking additional factors into account.},

abstract = {The soil water content is recognized as one of many runoff controlling factors in semiarid environments. A simple, physically based distributed model has been developed to study the role of antecedent soil water content in runoff generation in three small catchments in semiarid southeast Spain. The catchments were set up in two different zones: a burnt area with scarce vegetation and unburnt area with a denser plant cover. The infiltration process is determined by the Green-Ampt equation and the initial soil water content is taken into account by means of maps obtained by Conditional Gaussian simulation. The model was run 2700 times with different soil moisture scenarios and design storms. Stochastic sensitivity analysis was used to examine the role of antecedent soil water content in the runoff response. The results showed that the hydrological response after high intensity, low frequency storms is independent of the initial soil water content. On the other hand, the antecedent soil water content is an important factor controlling runoff during medium and low intensity storms, a type of rainstorm that is relatively frequent in semiarid areas. The sensitivity of the runoff response to soil moisture depended on the predominant runoff mechanisms. When infiltration excess overland flow is predominant, as a result of high rain intensities or less permeable soils, the runoff response is more uniform and does not depend on initial soil moisture. Runoff from less intense storms on soils of higher permeability is controlled by the soil water content of the surface soil layers and is more dependent on initial conditions. The role of the initial soil water content is more important in catchments where the presence of plant cover produces a patchwork of runoff and runon sites, whose spatial pattern is highly dependent on the soil water status. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ephemeral streams are typical Mediterranean fluvial systems with high risk of flash flooding, and few data are available about these systems in most locales. However, the SAIH network (Automatic Hydrological Information Systems) of the Jucar River Water Authority has been providing detailed information about ephemeral streams in Spain every 5min since 1988. Using these data, we evaluated the processes of rainfall-runoff conversion and flood generation in five Mediterranean ephemeral streams ranging in size from 25 to 450km2. To provide a general framework for hydrological analysis, the study included 142 flash flood events registered between 1989 and 2007. A more detailed analysis was conducted for the Carraixet Basin under the dry antecedent moisture condition (AMC I) to evaluate the influence of rainfall on the basin's response. A simple index called Momentum of Maximum Intensity (MMI) was developed to describe the influence of rainfall intensity on hydrograph. Correlations between the main indicators of precipitation and flow also were assessed. Results showed that flash floods were generally generated by average accumulated rainfall of around 100mm at high intensities that could exceed 300mm/h. Initial abstractions and average water losses during the rainfall-runoff conversion processes were very important (runoff coefficients of 6{\%} and runoff thresholds of 62mm). No correlation was found between initial abstractions (Ia ) calculated from the basin characteristics and runoff thresholds (P 0) empirically obtained, which create some doubts about the validity of Ia method for predicting floods in ephemeral streams. Accumulated rainfall was very important for flood volume, peak flow and water balance indicators, whereas intensity indicators were more related to the response times of the basins. Rainfall intensity variables influenced lag time. Accumulated rainfall, in combination with high reduced mean intensity and low persistence, were a good predictor for high peak flow. Finally, the analysis revealed two types of events. The first type, typical of summer and early autumn, consists of fast events characterized by intense rainfall concentrated at the beginning of the storm and high values of persistence and irregularity. The basin responds quickly and generates hydrographs that resemble the pattern of rain. The second type, representative of winter and spring, corresponds to less intense events. Although they accumulate more rain, maximum intensities are lower and occur at the end of the episode. The response of the basin is late, and hydrographs are quite different from hyetographs and very influenced by the basin.},

This type of flood, often affecting ungauged watersheds, remains nevertheless a poorly documented phenomenon. To address the gap in available information, and particularly to assess the possible ranges for peak discharges on watersheds with area smaller than 500 km2 and to describe the geography of the hazard across Europe, an intensive data compilation has been carried out for seven European hydrometeorological regions. This inventory is the first step towards an atlas of extreme flash floods in Europe. It contains over 550 documented events. This paper aims at presenting the data compilation strategy, the content of the elaborated data base and some preliminary data analysis results. The initial observations show that the most extreme flash floods are greater in magnitude in the Mediterranean countries than in the inner continental countries and that there is a strong seasonality to flash flood occurrence revealing different climatic forcing mechanisms in each region. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, the atmospheric, hydrological and geomorphic controls on these hydrogeomorphic processes are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain warning and risk management.

The objective of this paper is to provide a review on current European and international research on early warning systems for flash floods and debris flows. We expand upon these themes by identifying: (a) the state of the art; (b) knowledge gaps; and (c) suggested research directions to advance warning capabilities for extreme hydrogeomorphic processes. We also suggest three areas in which advancements in science will have immediate and important practical consequence, namely development of rainfall estimation and nowcasting schemes suited to the specific space-time scales, consolidating physical, engineering and social datasets of flash floods and debris-flows, integration of methods for multiple hydrogeomorphic hazard warning.},

abstract = {The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River. Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013 and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas. Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling (Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering three different scenarios associated with the initial construction (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population. Specific stage???damage functions were expressly developed using in situ data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit value were established. The relationship between water depth and the height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function. Other nonspecific magnitude???damage functions were used in order to compare both economic estimates. The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude???damage functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses, partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well as the types of flood that affect it.},

abstract = {Ambiguities in the representation of environmental processes have manifested themselves in a plethora of hydrological models, differing in almost every aspect of their conceptualization and implementation. The current overabundance of models is symptomatic of an insufficient scientific understanding of environmental dynamics at the catchment scale, which can be attributed to difficulties in measuring and representing the heterogeneity encountered in natural systems. This commentary advocates using the method of multiple working hypotheses for systematic and stringent testing of model alternatives in hydrology. We discuss how the multiple-hypothesis approach provides the flexibility to formulate alternative representations (hypotheses) describing both individual processes and the overall system. When combined with incisive diagnostics to scrutinize multiple model representations against observed data, this provides hydrologists with a powerful and systematic approach for model development and improvement. Multiple-hypothesis frameworks also support a broader coverage of the model hypothesis space and hence improve the quantification of predictive uncertainty arising from system and component nonidentifiabilities. As part of discussing the advantages and limitations of multiple-hypothesis frameworks, we critically review major contemporary challenges in hydrological hypothesis-testing, including exploiting different types of data to investigate the fidelity of alternative process representations, accounting for model structure ambiguities arising from major uncertainties in environmental data, quantifying regional differences in dominant hydrological processes, and the grander challenge of understanding the self-organization and optimality principles that may functionally explain and describe the heterogeneities evident in most environmental systems. We assess recent progress in these research directions, and how new advances are possible using multiple-hypothesis methodologies.},

Some of these avalanches were already known, but others had not been documented. In one case, the existing avalanche path map was improved with the dendrogeomorphological information of a larger past event. As a result of the dendrogeomorphological analyses, evidence for three regional-scale major avalanche years was identified in the SE Pyrenees from 1971 to 2004: 1971-1972, 1995-1996 and 2002-2003. The specific synoptic atmospheric situations and the most likely nivometeorological and snowpack conditions that released these major avalanches were determined using weather data for the seasons of major avalanche releases. In 1971-1972 the snow avalanche episode was characterized by a deep trough crossing the Pyrenees. In 1995-1996 a variety of meteorological situations produced several episodes of major avalanches. In 2002-2003 the more significant of two episodes was attributed to a north advection pumping an arctic air mass over the Pyrenees.

@article{Wagener2007,
abstract = {Approximately one-third of the Earth's land surface is located in arid or semi-arid regions, often in areas suffering severely from the negative impacts of desertification and population pressure. Reliable hydrological forecasts across spatial and temporal scales are crucial to achieve water security, i.e. protection from excess and lack of water, for people and ecosystems in these areas. At short temporal scales, flash floods are extremely dangerous hazards accounting, for example, for more than 80{\%} of all flood-related deaths in the USA. Forecasting of these floods requires a connected spatially-distributed hydro-meteorological modelling system which accounts for the specific meteorological and hydrological characteristics of semi-arid watersheds, e.g. summertime convective rainfall and channel transmission losses. The spatially highly heterogeneous nature of the precipitation and the non-linear response behaviour of the system demand the explicit accounting and propagation of uncertainties into the model predictions. This short paper presents the results of a multi-year study in which such a system was developed for flash-flood forecasting in the semi-arid southwestern USA. In particular, we discuss our effort to understand and estimate underlying uncertainties in such a modelling system. To achieve this we use the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework approach to uncertainty analysis, in combination with a variance-based global sensitivity analysis technique. The system was tested using gauge and radar estimates of rainfall for eight summertime convective thunderstorm events in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed near Tombstone, Arizona. In general, the level of uncertainty found was very high and largely dominated by uncertainty in the radar rainfall estimates. Regarding the model parameters, uncertainties in the hillslope model parameter values had a greater impact on the predictions than the uncertainties in the channel parameters, at least for relatively small basins.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {In this paper we review threshold behaviour in environmental systems, which are often associated with the onset of floods, contamination and erosion events, and other degenerative processes. Key objectives of this review are to a) suggest indicators for detecting threshold behavior, b) discuss their implications for predictability, c) distinguish different forms of threshold behavior and their underlying controls, and d) hypothesise on possible reasons for why threshold behaviour might occur. Threshold behaviour involves a fast qualitative change of either a single process or the response of a system. For elementary phenomena this switch occurs when boundary conditions (e.g., energy inputs) or system states as expressed by dimensionless quantities (e.g. the Reynolds number) exceed threshold values. Mixing, water movement or depletion of thermodynamic gradients becomes much more efficient as a result. Intermittency is a very good indicator for detecting event scale threshold behavior in hydrological systems. Predictability of intermittent processes/system responses is inherently low for combinations of systems states and/or boundary conditions that push the system close to a threshold. Post hoc identification of `cause-effect relations' to explain when the system became critical is inherently difficult because of our limited ability to perform observations under controlled identical experimental conditions. In this review, we distinguish three forms of threshold behavior. The first one is threshold behavior at the process level that is controlled by the interplay of local soil characteristics and states, vegetation and the rainfall forcing. Overland flow formation, particle detachment and preferential flow are examples of this. The second form of threshold behaviour is the response of systems of intermediate complexity - e.g., catchment runoff response and sediment yield - governed by the redistribution of water and sediments in space and time. These are controlled by the topological architecture of the catchments that interacts with system states and the boundary conditions. Crossing the response thresholds means to establish connectedness of surface or subsurface flow paths to the catchment outlet. Subsurface stormflow in humid areas, overland flow and erosion in semi-arid and arid areas are examples, and explain that crossing local process thresholds is necessary but not sufficient to trigger a system response threshold. The third form of threshold behaviour involves changes in the `architecture' of human geo-ecosystems, which experience various disturbances. As a result substantial change in hydrological functioning of a system is induced, when the disturbances exceed the resilience of the geo-ecosystem. We present examples from savannah ecosystems, humid agricultural systems, mining activities affecting rainfall runoff in forested areas, badlands formation in Spain, and the restoration of the Upper Rhine river basin as examples of this phenomenon. This functional threshold behaviour is most difficult to predict, since it requires extrapolations far away from our usual experience and the accounting of bidirectional feedbacks. However, it does not require the development of more complicated model, but on the contrary, only models with the right level of simplification, which we illustrate with an instructive example. Following Prigogine, who studied structure formation in open thermodynamic systems, we hypothesise that topological structures which control response thresholds in the landscape might be seen as dissipative structures, nd the onset of threshold processes/response as a switch to more efficient ways of depleting strong gradients that develop in the case of extreme boundary conditions.},

We start by describing the evolution of the two UNESCO activities (FRIEND and HELP) and the new initiative of the International Association of Hydrologi- cal Sciences (IAHS) called PUB. We then explore possible areas of intersection among FRIEND, HELP and PUB and list the hitherto unrealized opportunities for research that would add value to each programme and, consequently, hydrological sciences and integrated drainage-basin management.

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {One of the main problems of flood hazard assessment in ungauged or poorly gauged basins is the lack of runoff data. In an attempt to overcome this problem we have combined archival records, dendrogeomorphic time series and instrumental data (daily rainfall and discharge) from four ungauged and poorly gauged mountain basins in Central Spain with the aim of reconstructing and compiling information on 41 flash flood events since the end of the 19th century. Estimation of historical discharge and the incorporation of uncertainty for the at-site and regional flood frequency analysis were performed with an empirical rainfall-runoff assessment as well as stochastic and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. Results for each of the ungauged basins include flood frequency, severity, seasonality and triggers (synoptic meteorological situations). The reconstructed data series clearly demonstrates how uncertainty can be reduced by including historical information, but also points to the considerable influence of different approaches on quantile estimation. This uncertainty should be taken into account when these data are used for flood risk management. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) product was evaluated with the rain gauge network at monthly and daily time-scales considering various time periods and rainfall rate thresholds. Statistical analysis indicated that GSMaP shows acceptable linear correlation coefficient with rain gauges however suffers from significant underestimation bias. A rainfall rate threshold of 1 mm/month was the best choice to improve the match between GSMaP and rain gauges implying that appropriate threshold selection is critically important for the bias correction. Multiplicative bias correction was applied to GSMaP data using the bias factors calculated between GSMaP and observed rainfall. Hydrological River Basin Environmental Assessment Model (Hydro-BEAM) was used to simulate flash floods at the hourly time scale driven by the corrected GSMaP rainfall data. The model parameters were calibrated for flash flood events during October-December 2007 and then validated for flash flood events during October-December 2009. The results show that the simulated surface runoff hydrographs reasonably coincide with the observed hydrographs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The algorithms separate the radar echoes into convective and stratiform regions, statistically summarize the vertical structure of the radar echoes, and determine precipitation rates and amounts on high spatial resolution. The convective and stratiform regions are separated on the basis of the intensity and sharpness of the peaks of echo intensity. The peaks indicate the centers of the convective region.

abstract = {Heavy rainstorms often induce flash flooding, one of the natural disasters most responsible for damage to man-made infrastructure and loss of lives, adversely affecting also the opportunities for socio-economic development of Mediterranean Countries. The frequently dramatic damage of flash floods are often detected with sufficient accuracy by post-event surveys, but rainfall causing them are still only roughly characterized. With the aim of improving the understanding of the temporal structure and spatial distribution of heavy rainstorms in the Mediterranean context, a statistical analysis was carried out in Calabria (southern Italy) concerning rainstorms that mainly induced flash floods, but also shallow landslides and debris-flows. Thus a method is proposed – based on the overcoming of heuristically predetermined threshold values of cumulated rainfall, maximum intensity, and kinetic energy of the rainfall event – to select and characterize the rainstorms able to induce flash floods in the Mediterranean-climate Countries. Therefore the obtained (heavy) rainstorms were automatically classified and studied according to their structure in time, localization and extension. Rainfall-runoff watershed models can consequently benefit from the enhanced identification of design storms, with a realistic time structure integrated with the results of the spatial analysis. A survey of flash flood events recorded in the last decades provides a preliminary validation of the method proposed to identify the heavy rainstorms and synthetically describe their characteristics. The notable size of the employed sample, including data with a very detailed resolution in time, that relate to several rain gauges well-distributed throughout the region, give robustness to the obtained results.},

The paper starts with an overview of flash floods and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of, and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996???2011) but more extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation. Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective contribution to rainfall, introducing the ?? parameter as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as a multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events. The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values of precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain this positive trend in flash flood events. The ?? parameter has been also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short and local events, usually with daily ?? values above 0.5, while the minimum threshold of daily ?? for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.},

abstract = {Just as with the storms that cause them, flash floods are highly variable and non-linear phenomena in both time and space; hence understanding and anticipating the genesis of flash floods is far from straightforward. There is therefore a huge requirement for tools with the potential to provide advance warning of situations likely to lead to flash floods, and thus provide additional time for the flood forecasting services. The Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) method is used on US catchments to estimate the average number of inches of rainfall for given durations required to produce flash flooding. This rainfall amount is used afterwards as a flood warning threshold. In Europe, flash floods often occur on small catchments (approximately 100 km2) and it has already been shown that the spatial variability of rainfall has a great impact on the catchment response (Le Lay and Saulnier, 2007). Therefore, in this study, an improved FFG method which accounts for rainfall spatial variability is proposed. The objectives of this paper are (i) to assess the FFG method applicability on French Mediterranean catchments with a distributed process-oriented hydrological model and (ii) to assess the effect of the rainfall spatial variability on this method. The results confirm the influence of the spatial variability of rainfall events in relation with its interaction with soil properties.},

abstract = {This study documents the preferred location and diurnal cycle of extreme convective storms that occur in the tropical band containing the east Pacific Ocean, Central and South America, the Atlantic Ocean, and northern Africa. Data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar show three types of convective-stratiform structures that constitute extreme convective events: deep convective cores (DCCs), wide convective cores (WCCs), and broad stratiform regions (BSRs). Interim ECMWF Re- Analysis (ERA-Interim) data show the associated synoptic environmental factors associated with the oc- currence of extreme convective features. The DCC, WCC, and BSRechoes are associated with early, middle, and late stages of convective system development, respectively, and the statistics and timing of their occur- rence are related to topography and life cycle behavior of the convection. Storms containing DCC occur primarily over the Sudanian savannas of Africa and near the mountains in northern South America, being diurnally controlled. Storms with WCC manifest over land, in the same regions as the DCC, but also over oceanic regions. They appear around the clock but with maximum frequency at night. They are favored in regions of midlevel synoptic-scale low pressure systems, which over the sub-Sahara are the troughs of easterly waves. Storms containing BSR maximize over oceanic regions west of Africa and South America, where they exhibit a weak diurnal cycle with a slight midmorning maximum. Off the west coast of South America, the storms withWCCand BSR have longer lifetimes enhanced by orographic lifting over the Andes. The storms with BSR in the east Pacific Ocean often develop into tropical cyclones. 1.},

abstract = {A spatially distributed hydrological model, dedicated to flood simulation, is developed on the basis of physical process representation (infiltration, overland flow, channel routing). Estimation of model parameters requires data concerning topography, soil properties, vegetation and land use. Four parameters are calibrated for the entire catchment using one flood event. Model sensitivity to individual parameters is assessed using Monte-Carlo simulations. Results of this sensitivity analysis with a criterion based on the Nash efficiency coefficient and the error of peak time and runoff are used to calibrate the model. This procedure is tested on the Gardon d'Anduze catchment, located in the Mediterranean zone of southern France. A first validation is conducted using three flood events with different hydrometeorological characteristics. This sensitivity analysis along with validation tests illustrates the predictive capability of the model and points out the possible improvements on the model's structure and parameterization for flash flood forecasting, especially in ungauged basins. Concerning the model structure, results show that water transfer through the subsurface zone also contributes to the hydrograph response to an extreme event, especially during the recession period. Maps of soil saturation emphasize the impact of rainfall and soil properties variability on these dynamics. Adding a subsurface flow component in the simulation also greatly impacts the spatial distribution of soil saturation and shows the importance of the drainage network. Measures of such distributed variables would help discriminating between different possible model structures.},

abstract = {—As part of a long-range program on the hydrology of small watersheds, a corre­ lation between the two-year, one-hour rainfall intensity at 126 recording rainfall stations in northern California and related topographic and climatic parameters has been made. The re­ sulting correlation has a coefficient of correlation of 0.88 and a standard error of 0.067 inch/ hour. With this relation, it is possible to show the variation of rainfall intensity over the area in much greater detail than has hitherto been possible from observed intensity data alone. This paper discusses the parameters employed, the methods of correlation, and the results obtained. Introduction—One of the problems in any study of rainfall intensity is the limited number of stations with record suitable for frequency analy­ sis. For a regional study, data are limited to the hydrologic network stations available since about 1940. After preliminary study, it was decided to limit this analysis to California north of 35° N to avoid introducing large scale climatic factors. In this area approximately 150 station records were available for use. After screening to eliminate records which were too short or were composites from several station locations the number was reduced to 126. The maximum length of record was ten years and the average length substantially less. Conse­ quently the two-year, one hour intensity was adopted as the best choice of a dependent param­ eter. Since clock-hour data were readily avail­ able, these were used although the maximum 60-min values would be somewhat higher. Occasional summer thunderstdrms produce high-intensity rains in California. Because these storms are the result of quite different meterological processes, they were excluded from the analysis by using only the September through April period. Since most of these summer rains fall on dry ground and pro­ duce little runoff, this exclusion does not seem to affect the utility of the results. The general technique utilized is that previously employed by Spreen [1947] Burns [1952], and others for relating mean annual or mean seasonal pre­ cipitation to topography. The coaxial method of graphical correlation [Linsley and others, 1949] was employed because of the flexibility it offers. Since a relatively large number of stations was to be analyzed, data were transcribed onto Key sort punched cards. These cards could be easily strati­ fied and average values computed for each pa­ rameter as needed. The complete study [Linsley, 1956] involved comparison of four alternative relationships. This paper reports only the one which seems to offer the best results. Index daily rainfall—It is a logical assumption that, within a small region where the occurrence of rainfall at all stations is limited to about the same number of hours in a year, hourly intensities will bear some relation to mean annual precipita­ tion. The study area is too large for strict adherence to this assumption and a parameter called index daily rainfall was defined by},

abstract = {Flash floods represent one of the most destructive natural hazards in the Mediterranean region. These floods result from very intense and spatially heterogeneous rainfall events. Distributed hydrological models are valuable tools to study these phenomena and increase our knowledge on the main processes governing the generation and propagation of floods over large spatial scales. They are generally built using a bottom???up approach that generalizes small-physics representations of processes. However, top???down or data-driven approach is increasingly shown to provide also valuable knowledge. A simplified semi-distributed continuous hydrological model, named SIMPLEFLOOD, was developed, based on the simple dynamical system approach (SDSA) proposed by Kirchner (WRR, 2009, 45, W02429), and applied to the Ard??che catchment in France (2388 km2). This data-driven method assumes that discharge at the outlet of a given catchment can be expressed as a function only of catchment storage. It leads to a 3-parameter nonlinear model according to rainfall and runoff observations. This model was distributed over sub-catchments and coupled with a kinematic wave based flow propagation module. The parameters were estimated by discharge recession analyses at several gauged stations. Parameter regionalization was conducted using a Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Hierarchical Classification on Principal Component (HCPC) in order to find relationships between the SDSA approach and catchments characteristics. Geology was found to be the main predictor of hydrological response variability and model parameters were regionalized according to the dominant geology. The SIMPLEFLOOD model was applied for a 12-year continuous simulation over the Ard??che catchment. Four flash flood events were also selected for further analysis. The simulated hydrographs were compared with the observations at 11 gauging stations with catchment size ranging from 17 to 2300 km2. The results show a good performance of the model for the continuous and flash flood events occurring under wet conditions, whereas the model underestimates discharge for events occurring after a long dry period. The simple modeling approach provided interesting insight into the Ard??che catchment functioning and offers perspective for a better simulation of flash floods, mainly under wet conditions.},

The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mesoscale convective cloud systems that produce large amounts of rain in mid-latitudes and most of the rain in the tropics consist of a combination of convective and stratiform cloud. The convective regions contain numerous deep cells that are often but not always arranged in Lines. The stratiform region is an outgrowth of the convective ensemble; it lies adjacent to the convective region and is seeded by ice particles detrained from convective towers. Sometimes it lies to the rear of a propagating convective line, while on other occasions it surrounds the convection. The heating of the large-scale environment by a mesoscale convective system is affected by both the convective and stratiform regions. Although processes such as melting and radiation are important, the net heating by a system is dominated by condensation and evaporation associated with vertical air motions. This paper reviews recent observational evidence regarding the mean vertical motion profiles in the convective and stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems and the implications of these mean motions for the vertical distribution of heating of the large-scale environment. In both the convective and the stratiform regions, vertical motions have been determined by various techniques, including composites of rawinsonde and aircraft wind data, single- and dual-Doppler precipitation radar analyses, and wind-profiler observations. In stratiform regions, these data consistently show mean vertical velocity that is upward in the upper troposphere and downward in the lower troposphere. The level separating upward from downward motion is located from 0 to 2 km above the 0°C level, depending on location within the stratiform region. Diagnostic calculations show that these vertical motion profiles imply heating of the upper troposphere and cooling of lower levels by stratiform-region processes. Data on vertical motions in the convective regions are less consistent from case to case. These data sometimes indicate that the mean vertical velocity in convective regions is maximum in the lower troposphere. In other cases, the data indicate a maximum in the high troposphere. Diagnostic calculations show that heating profiles diagnosed from these two types of profile are quite different, the first having a maximum of heating in the lower troposphere, while the second has a maximum in the middle troposphere. Although it is difficult to determine whether or not the differences in estimates arise from different types of observations, analysis methods or sampling strategies, it seems likely that they stem from differences in the large-scale environment of the different mesoscale systems. The ubiquitous occurrence of stratiform regions in mesoscale convective systems and hurricanes together with their consistent heating profiles, which systematically concentrate heating in upper levels while cooling lower levels, are a major consideration in evaluating the interaction of mesoscale systems with the large-scale environment. However, the consistency of the stratiform profiles from case to case indicates that the variability of net (convective plus stratiform) heating profiles from case to case ties primarily in the variation of the convective-region profiles from one case to another. It is suggested that future work should focus on the convective-region vertical profiles of vertical motion and heating and on the large-scale environmental factors that may control the variation of these profiles from case to case. 1.},

abstract = {Implementation of flood warning systems and community self-help programs is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the flash-flood risk. Inmany instances, these are the only affordable and sustainable mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, flash-flood warning is still hampered by changes in societal needs and by our limited knowledge of atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of this type of flood. On the one hand, flood warning has traditionally focused on localized targets for the protection of communities and for the management of hydraulic reservoirs. Given the general development of dispersed urbanization and transportation, and the expansion of green tourism and water sports in mountainous regions, human lives and property are increasingly exposed to flash-flood hazard in a scatteredmanner. This means that every river section of a monitored region can be considered as a potential target for flood warning. On the other hand, our poor knowledge of this phenomenon comes from the fact that, in most flash-flood cases, the rain accumulations and the discharges are simply unknown over most of the watersheds of concern. Flash floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems of rain and discharge in rivers are not able to monitor. As these events are locally rare, they also escape the realm of field-based experimentation. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of flash floods are poorly understood. Progress in flash-flood research is hampered by three main prob- lems: (i) the downscaling problem due to the incoherent space and time scales between atmospheric models and the flash-flood trigger- ing processes; (ii) the ungauged basin problem due to the fact that the small basins prone to flash-floods are seldom gauged and must be modelled without calibration; and (iii) the problem of knowing the limits of the soil retention control of runoff under the range of rain accumulations considered. Our view is that weather radar net- works deeply modify the flash flood monitoring problem. Combin- ing radar detection of rain and distributed hydrological modelling shows considerable potential for improving both the understanding of fundamental scientific questions, including extreme storms and runoff production mechanisms, and the ‘distributed' monitoring of the flash-flood hazard. This short commentary addresses some of these developments and identifies some new research needs in radar hydrology.},

abstract = {We have conducted extensive hydrologic simulation experiments in order to investigate how the flood scaling parameters in the power-law relationship Q(A) = $\alpha$A$\theta$, between peak-discharges resulting from a single rainfall-runoff event Q(A) and upstream area A, change as a function of rainfall, runoff coefficient (C r) that we use as a proxy for catchment antecedent moisture state, hillslope overland flow velocity (vh), and channel flow velocity (vc), all of which are variable in space. We use a physically-based distributed numerical framework that is based on an accurate representation of the drainage network and apply it to the Cedar River basin (A = 16, 861 km2), which is located in Eastern Iowa, USA. Our work is motivated by seminal empirical studies that show that the flood scaling parameters $\alpha$ and $\theta$ change from event to event. Uncovering the underlying physical mechanism behind the event-to-event variability of $\alpha$ and $\theta$ in terms of catchment physical processes and rainfall properties would significantly improve our ability to predict peak-discharge in ungauged basins (PUB). The simulation results demonstrate how both $\alpha$ and $\theta$ are systematically controlled by the interplay among rainfall duration T, spatially averaged rainfall intensity E[I], as well as E[C r], E[vh], and vc. Specifically, we found that the value of $\theta$ generally decreases with increasing values of E[I], E[C r], and E[vh], whereas its value generally increases with increasing T. Moreover, while $\alpha$ is primarily controlled by E[I], it increases with increasing E[C r] and E[vh]. These results highlight the fact that the flood scaling parameters are able to be estimated from the aforementioned catchment rainfall and physical variables, which can be measured either directly or indirectly. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Floods, landslides and debris flows are natural events that occur all over the world and are often induced by extreme rainfall conditions. Several extreme events occurred in Slovenia (Europe) in the last 25. years that caused 18 casualties and approximately 500. million Euros of economic loss. The intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationship was constructed using the Frank copula function for several rainfall stations using high-resolution rainfall data with an average subsample length of 34. years. The empirical rainfall threshold curves were also evaluated for selected extreme events. Post-event analyses showed that rainfall characteristics triggering flash floods and landslides are different. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the inter-event time definition (IETD) and subsample definition methodology can have a significant influence on the position of rainfall events in the intensity-duration space, the constructed IDF curves and on the relationship between the empirical rainfall threshold curves and the IDF curves constructed using the copula approach. Furthermore, a combination of several empirical rainfall thresholds with an appropriate high-density rainfall measurement network can be used as part of the early warning system of the initiation of landslides and debris flows. However, different rainfall threshold curves should be used for lowland and mountainous areas in Slovenia.},

Here, we propose and test a novel approach for predicting runoff from poorly gauged basins using a minimum complex model calibrated with isotope data alone (i.e., without observed discharge data). The model is composed of two water-stores (soil water and groundwater) and considers their connectivity to runoff in terms of both water and isotope budgets. In a meso-scale basin in which riverbed deformations frequently occur, making automatic observation of river discharge difficult, we measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition ($\delta$2H and $\delta$18O) of precipitation and river water twice-weekly for one year. Runoff predicted by the model agreed well with that observed monthly or bimonthly. Monte Carlo simulation revealed a strong coherence between model performance in isotope simulation and runoff prediction, demonstrating that the use of isotopes as dynamic proxies of calibration targets helps reliably constrain model parameters. Our results indicate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for prediction of runoff hydrographs, particularly for basins in which the stage-discharge relationship is highly variable.},

abstract = {The 2 June 2008 flood-producing storm on the Starzel river basin in South-West Germany is examined as a prototype for organized convective systems that dominate the upper tail of the precipitation frequency distribution and are likely responsible for the flash flood peaks in Central Europe. The availability of high-resolution rainfall estimates from radar observations and a rain gauge network, together with indirect peak discharge estimates from a detailed post-event survey, provided the opportunity to study in detail the hydrometeorological and hydrological mechanisms associated with this extreme storm and the ensuing flood. Radar-derived rainfall, streamgauge data and indirect estimates of peak discharges are used along with a distributed hydrologic model to reconstruct hydrographs at multiple locations. Observations and model results are combined to examine two main questions, (i) assessment of the distribution of the runoff ratio for the 2008 flash flood and how it compares with other less severe floods; and (ii) analysis of how the spatial and temporal distribution of the extreme rainfall, and more specifically storm motion, controls the flood response. It is shown that small runoff ratios (less than 20{\%}) characterized the runoff response and that these values are in the range of other, less extreme, flood events. The influence of storm structure, evolution and motion on the modeled flood hydrograph is examined by using the "spatial moments of catchment rainfall". It is shown that downbasin storm motion (in the range of 0.7-0.9 m s(-1)) had a noticeable impact on flood response by increasing the modeled flood peak by 13 {\%}.},

abstract = {Baseflow is often considered to be the groundwater discharge component of streamflow. It is commonly estimated using conceptual models, recursive filters or a combination of the two. However, it is difficult to validate these methods due to the current challenges of measuring baseflow in the field. In this study, simulation of a synthetic catchment's response to rainfall is carried out using a fully integrated surface water-groundwater flow model. A series of rainfall events with differing recovery periods and varied antecedent moisture conditions is considered to span a range of different streamflow generation dynamics. Baseflow is estimated for the outlet hydrograph of the synthetic catchment using a selection of commonly used automated baseflow separation methods. These estimates are compared to the baseflow signal obtained from the numerical model, which serves as the control experiment. Results from these comparisons show that depending on the method used, automated baseflow separation underestimates the simulated baseflow by as much as 28{\%}, or overestimates it by up to 74{\%}, during rainfall events. No separation method is found to be clearly superior to the others, as the performance of the various methods varies with different soil types, antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall events. The differences between the various approaches clearly demonstrate that the baseflow separation methods investigated are not universally applicable. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This type of flood, often affecting ungauged watersheds, remains nevertheless a poorly documented phenomenon. To address the gap in available information, and particularly to assess the possible ranges for peak discharges on watersheds with area smaller than 500 km2 and to describe the geography of the hazard across Europe, an intensive data compilation has been carried out for seven European hydrometeorological regions. This inventory is the first step towards an atlas of extreme flash floods in Europe. It contains over 550 documented events. This paper aims at presenting the data compilation strategy, the content of the elaborated data base and some preliminary data analysis results. The initial observations show that the most extreme flash floods are greater in magnitude in the Mediterranean countries than in the inner continental countries and that there is a strong seasonality to flash flood occurrence revealing different climatic forcing mechanisms in each region. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this commentary is to describe the areas of intersection between three international water research efforts and to explore synergies between them. We start by describing the evolution of the two UNESCO activities (FRIEND and HELP) and the new initiative of the International Association of Hydrologi- cal Sciences (IAHS) called PUB. We then explore possible areas of intersection among FRIEND, HELP and PUB and list the hitherto unrealized opportunities for research that would add value to each programme and, consequently, hydrological sciences and integrated drainage-basin management.

abstract = {This study presents an application of an inno- vative sampling strategy to assess soil moisture dynamics in a headwater of the Wei{\ss}eritz in the German eastern Ore Mountains. A grassland site and a forested site were in- strumented with two Spatial TDR clusters (STDR) that con- sist of 39 and 32 coated TDR probes of 60cm length. Dis- tributed time series of vertically averaged soil moisture data from both sites/ensembles were analyzed by statistical and geostatistical methods. Spatial variability and the spatial mean at the forested site were larger than at the grassland site. Furthermore, clustering of TDR probes in combination with long-term monitoring allowed identification of average spatial covariance structures at the small field scale for dif- ferent wetness states. The correlation length of soil water content as well as the sill to nugget ratio at the grassland site increased with increasing average wetness and but, in contrast, were constant at the forested site. As soil proper- ties at both the forested and grassland sites are extremely variable, this suggests that the correlation structure at the forested site is dominated by the pattern of throughfall and interception. We also found a very strong correlation be- tween antecedent soil moisture at the forested site and runoff coefficients of rainfall-runoff events observed at gauge Rehe- feld. Antecedent soil moisture at the forest site explains 92{\%} of the variability in the runoff coefficients. By combining these results with a recession analysis we derived a first con- ceptual model of the dominant runoff mechanisms operating in this catchment. Finally, we employed a physically based hydrological model to shed light on the controls of soil- and plant morphological parameters on soil average soil moisture at the forested site and the grassland site, respectively. A homogeneous soil setup allowed, after fine tuning of plant morphological parameters, most of the time unbiased predic- tions of the observed average soil conditions observed at both field sites. We conclude that the proposed sampling strategy of clustering TDR probes is suitable to assess unbiased aver- age soil moisture dynamics in critical functional units, in this case the forested site, which is a much better predictor for event scale runoff formation than pre-event discharge. Long term monitoring of such critical landscape elements could maybe yield valuable information for flood warning in head- waters. We thus think that STDR provides a good intersect of the advantages of permanent sampling and spatially highly resolved soil moisture sampling using mobile rods.},

abstract = {A spatially distributed hydrological model, dedicated to flood simulation, is developed on the basis of physical process representation (infiltration, overland flow, channel routing). Estimation of model parameters requires data concerning topography, soil properties, vegetation and land use. Four parameters are calibrated for the entire catchment using one flood event. Model sensitivity to individual parameters is assessed using Monte-Carlo simulations. Results of this sensitivity analysis with a criterion based on the Nash efficiency coefficient and the error of peak time and runoff are used to calibrate the model. This procedure is tested on the Gardon d'Anduze catchment, located in the Mediterranean zone of southern France. A first validation is conducted using three flood events with different hydrometeorological characteristics. This sensitivity analysis along with validation tests illustrates the predictive capability of the model and points out the possible improvements on the model's structure and parameterization for flash flood forecasting, especially in ungauged basins. Concerning the model structure, results show that water transfer through the subsurface zone also contributes to the hydrograph response to an extreme event, especially during the recession period. Maps of soil saturation emphasize the impact of rainfall and soil properties variability on these dynamics. Adding a subsurface flow component in the simulation also greatly impacts the spatial distribution of soil saturation and shows the importance of the drainage network. Measures of such distributed variables would help discriminating between different possible model structures.},

Finally, we employed a physically based hydrological model to shed light on the controls of soil- and plant morphological parameters on soil average soil moisture at the forested site and the grassland site, respectively. A homogeneous soil setup allowed, after fine tuning of plant morphological parameters, most of the time unbiased predic- tions of the observed average soil conditions observed at both field sites. We conclude that the proposed sampling strategy of clustering TDR probes is suitable to assess unbiased aver- age soil moisture dynamics in critical functional units, in this case the forested site, which is a much better predictor for event scale runoff formation than pre-event discharge. Long term monitoring of such critical landscape elements could maybe yield valuable information for flood warning in head- waters. We thus think that STDR provides a good intersect of the advantages of permanent sampling and spatially highly resolved soil moisture sampling using mobile rods.},

abstract = {Flash floods and debris flows develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems for rainfall, streamflow and sediment discharge are not able to monitor. Consequently, the atmospheric, hydrological and geomorphic controls on these hydrogeomorphic processes are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain warning and risk management. On the other hand, remote sensing of precipitation and numerical weather predictions have become the basis of several flood forecasting systems, enabling increasingly accurate detection of hazardous events. The objective of this paper is to provide a review on current European and international research on early warning systems for flash floods and debris flows. We expand upon these themes by identifying: (a) the state of the art; (b) knowledge gaps; and (c) suggested research directions to advance warning capabilities for extreme hydrogeomorphic processes. We also suggest three areas in which advancements in science will have immediate and important practical consequence, namely development of rainfall estimation and nowcasting schemes suited to the specific space-time scales, consolidating physical, engineering and social datasets of flash floods and debris-flows, integration of methods for multiple hydrogeomorphic hazard warning.},

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to evaluate a threshold-based flash flood warning method, by considering a wide range of climatic and physiographic conditions, and by focusing on ungauged basins. The method is derived from the flash flood guidance (FFG, hereafter) approach. The FFG is the depth of rain of a given duration, taken as uniform in space and time on a certain basin, necessary to cause minor flooding at the outlet of the considered basin. This rainfall depth, which is computed based on a hydrological model, is compared to either real-time-observed or forecasted rainfall of the same duration and on the same basin. If the nowcasted or forecasted rainfall depth is greater than the FFG, then flooding in the basin is considered likely. The study provides an assessment of this technique based on operational quality data from 11 mountainous basins (six nested included in five larger parent basins) located in north-eastern Italy and central France. The model used in this study is a semi-distributed conceptual rainfall-runoff model, following the structure of the PDM (probability distributed moisture) model. Two general questions are addressed: (1) How does the efficiency of the method evolve when the simulation parameters can not be calibrated but must be transposed from parent gauged basins to ungauged basins? (2) How sensitive are the results to the method used to estimate the initial soil moisture status? System performances are evaluated by means of categorical statistics, such as the critical success index (CSI). Results show that overall CSI is equal to 0.43 for the parent basins, where the hydrological model has been calibrated. CSI reduces to 0.28 for the interior basins, when model parameters are transposed from parent basins, and to 0.21, when both model parameters and soil moisture status is transposed from parent basins. Performance differences between FFG and use of time-constant soil moisture status are very high for the parent basins and decrease with decreasing the system accuracy. The percent difference amounts to 53{\%} for the parent basins, to 25{\%} for interior basins with parameter transposition, and to 19{\%} for interior basins with parameter and soil moisture status transposition. These results improve our understanding of the applicability and reliability of this method at various scales and under various scenarios of data availability. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ephemeral streams are typical Mediterranean fluvial systems with high risk of flash flooding, and few data are available about these systems in most locales. However, the SAIH network (Automatic Hydrological Information Systems) of the Jucar River Water Authority has been providing detailed information about ephemeral streams in Spain every 5min since 1988. Using these data, we evaluated the processes of rainfall-runoff conversion and flood generation in five Mediterranean ephemeral streams ranging in size from 25 to 450km2. To provide a general framework for hydrological analysis, the study included 142 flash flood events registered between 1989 and 2007. A more detailed analysis was conducted for the Carraixet Basin under the dry antecedent moisture condition (AMC I) to evaluate the influence of rainfall on the basin's response. A simple index called Momentum of Maximum Intensity (MMI) was developed to describe the influence of rainfall intensity on hydrograph. Correlations between the main indicators of precipitation and flow also were assessed. Results showed that flash floods were generally generated by average accumulated rainfall of around 100mm at high intensities that could exceed 300mm/h. Initial abstractions and average water losses during the rainfall-runoff conversion processes were very important (runoff coefficients of 6{\%} and runoff thresholds of 62mm). No correlation was found between initial abstractions (Ia ) calculated from the basin characteristics and runoff thresholds (P 0) empirically obtained, which create some doubts about the validity of Ia method for predicting floods in ephemeral streams. Accumulated rainfall was very important for flood volume, peak flow and water balance indicators, whereas intensity indicators were more related to the response times of the basins. Rainfall intensity variables influenced lag time. Accumulated rainfall, in combination with high reduced mean intensity and low persistence, were a good predictor for high peak flow. Finally, the analysis revealed two types of events. The first type, typical of summer and early autumn, consists of fast events characterized by intense rainfall concentrated at the beginning of the storm and high values of persistence and irregularity. The basin responds quickly and generates hydrographs that resemble the pattern of rain. The second type, representative of winter and spring, corresponds to less intense events. Although they accumulate more rain, maximum intensities are lower and occur at the end of the episode. The response of the basin is late, and hydrographs are quite different from hyetographs and very influenced by the basin.},

abstract = {Implementation of flood warning systems and community self-help programs is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the flash-flood risk. Inmany instances, these are the only affordable and sustainable mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, flash-flood warning is still hampered by changes in societal needs and by our limited knowledge of atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of this type of flood. On the one hand, flood warning has traditionally focused on localized targets for the protection of communities and for the management of hydraulic reservoirs. Given the general development of dispersed urbanization and transportation, and the expansion of green tourism and water sports in mountainous regions, human lives and property are increasingly exposed to flash-flood hazard in a scatteredmanner. This means that every river section of a monitored region can be considered as a potential target for flood warning. On the other hand, our poor knowledge of this phenomenon comes from the fact that, in most flash-flood cases, the rain accumulations and the discharges are simply unknown over most of the watersheds of concern. Flash floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems of rain and discharge in rivers are not able to monitor. As these events are locally rare, they also escape the realm of field-based experimentation. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of flash floods are poorly understood. Progress in flash-flood research is hampered by three main prob- lems: (i) the downscaling problem due to the incoherent space and time scales between atmospheric models and the flash-flood trigger- ing processes; (ii) the ungauged basin problem due to the fact that the small basins prone to flash-floods are seldom gauged and must be modelled without calibration; and (iii) the problem of knowing the limits of the soil retention control of runoff under the range of rain accumulations considered. Our view is that weather radar net- works deeply modify the flash flood monitoring problem. Combin- ing radar detection of rain and distributed hydrological modelling shows considerable potential for improving both the understanding of fundamental scientific questions, including extreme storms and runoff production mechanisms, and the ‘distributed' monitoring of the flash-flood hazard. This short commentary addresses some of these developments and identifies some new research needs in radar hydrology.},

abstract = {Landslides are a main cause of human and economic losses worldwide. For this reason, landslide hazard assessment and the capacity to predict this phenomenon have been topics of great interest within the scientific community for the implementation of early warning systems. Although several models have been proposed to forecast shallow landslides triggered by rainfall, few models have incorporated geotechnical factors into a complete hydrological model of a basin that can simulate the storage and movement of rainwater through the soil profile. These basin and full hydrological models have adopted a physically based approach. This paper develops a conceptual and physically based model called open and distributed hydrological simulation and landslides—SHIA{\_}Landslide (Simulaci{\'{o}}n HIdrol{\'{o}}gica Abierta, or SHIA, in Spanish)—that is supported by geotechnical and hydrological features occurring on a basin-wide scale in tropical and mountainous terrains. SHIA{\_}Landslide is an original and significant contribution that offers a new perspective with which to analyse shallow landslide processes by incorporating a comprehensive distributed hydrological tank model that includes water storage in the soil coupled with a classical analysis of infinite slope stability under saturated conditions. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be distinguished by the following: (i) its capacity to capture surface topography and effects concerning the subsurface flow; (ii) its use of digital terrain model (DTM) to establish the relationships among cells, geomorphological parameters, slope angle, direction, etc.; (iii) its continuous simulation of rainfall data over long periods and event simulations of specific storms; (iv) its consideration of the effects of horizontal and vertical flow; and (vi) its inclusion of a hydrologically complete water process that allows for hydrological calibration. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be combined with real-time rainfall data and implemented in early warning systems.},

abstract = {Flash floods cause some of the most severe natural disasters in Europe but Mediterranean areas are especially vulnerable. They can cause devastating damage to property, infrastructures and loss of human life. The complexity of flash flood generation processes and their dependency on different factors related to watershed properties and rainfall characteristics make flash flood prediction a difficult task. In this study, as part of the EU-FLASH project, we used an uncalibrated hydrological model to simulate flow events in a 27km2 Mediterranean watershed in Israel to analyze and better understand the various factors influencing flows. The model is based on the well-known SCS curve number method for rainfall-runoff calculations and on the kinematic wave method for flow routing. Existing data available from maps, GIS and field studies were used to define model parameters, and no further calibration was conducted to obtain a better fit between computed and observed flow data. The model rainfall input was obtained from the high temporal and spatial resolution radar data adjusted to rain gauges. Twenty flow events that occurred within the study area over a 15year period were analyzed. The model shows a generally good capability in predicting flash flood peak discharge in terms of their general level, classified as low, medium or high (all high level events were correctly predicted). It was found that the model mainly well predicts flash floods generated by intense, short-lived convective storm events while model performances for low and moderate flows generated by more widespread winter storms were quite poor. The degree of urban development was found to have a large impact on runoff amount and peak discharge, with higher sensitivity of moderate and low flow events relative to high flows. Flash flood generation was also found to be very sensitive to the temporal distribution of rain intensity within a specific storm event. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The estimation of catchment-scale soil properties, such as water storage capacity and hydraulic conductivity, is of primary interest for the implementation of distributed hydrological models at the regional scale. This estimation is generally performed on the basis of information provided by soil databases. However, such databases are often established for agronomic uses and generally do not document deep-weathered rock horizons (i.e. pedologic horizons of type C and deeper), which can play a major role in water transfer and storages. Here, we define the Drainable Storage Capacity Index (DSCI), an indicator that relies on the comparison between cumulated streamflow and precipitation to assess catchment-scale storage capacities. DSCI is found to be reliable to detect underestimation of soil storage capacities in soil databases. We also use the streamflow recession analysis methodology defined by Brutsaert and Nieber in 1977 to estimate water storage capacities and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivities of the nondocumented deep horizons. The analysis is applied to a sample of 23 catchments (0.2-291km(2)) located in the Cevennes-Vivarais region (south of France). For regionalization purposes, the obtained results are compared with the dominant catchment geology and present a clear hierarchy between the different geologies of the area. Hard crystalline rocks are found to be associated with the thickest and less conductive deep soil horizons. Schist rocks present intermediate values of thickness and of saturated hydraulic conductivity, whereas sedimentary rocks and alluvium are found to be less thick and most conductive. These results are of primary interest in view of the future set-up of distributed hydrological models over the Cevennes-Vivarais region. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

This is especially the case in the Mediterranean and oversea territories/departments of France, characterized by extreme hydro-climatological features and with a large part of the population exposed to flood risks. The recurrence of remarkable flash flood events, associated with high hazard intensity, significant damage and socio-political consequences, therefore raises several issues for authorities and risk management policies. This study aims to improve our understanding of the hazard analysis process in the case of four remarkable flood events: March 1930, October 1940, January 1980 and November 1999. Firstly, we present the methodology used to define the remarkability score of a flood event. Then, to identify the factors leading to a remarkable flood event, we explore the main parameters of the hazard analysis process, such as the meteorological triggering conditions, the return period of the rainfall and peak discharge, as well as some additional factors (initial catchment state, flood chronology, cascade effects, etc.). The results contribute to understanding the complexity of the processes leading to flood hazard and highlight the importance for risk managers of taking additional factors into account.},

The paper starts with an overview of flash floods and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of, and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996???2011) but more extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation. Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective contribution to rainfall, introducing the ?? parameter as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as a multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events. The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values of precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain this positive trend in flash flood events. The ?? parameter has been also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short and local events, usually with daily ?? values above 0.5, while the minimum threshold of daily ?? for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.},

abstract = {A framework for a comprehensive synthetic rainfall-runoff database was developed to study catchment response to a variety of rainfall events. The framework supports effective flood risk assessment and management and implements simple approaches. It consists of three flexible components, a rainfall generator, a continuous rainfallrunoff model, and a database management system. The system was developed and tested at two gauged river sections along the upper Tiber River (central Italy). One of the main questions was to investigate how simple such approaches can be applied without impairing the quality of the results. The rainfall-runoff model was used to simulate runoff on the basis of a large number of rainfall events. The resulting rainfallrunoff database stores pre-simulated events classified on the basis of the rainfall amount, initial wetness conditions and initial discharge. The real-time operational forecasts follow an analogue method that does not need new model simulations. However, the forecasts are based on the simulation results available in the rainfall-runoff database (for the specific class to which the forecast belongs). Therefore, the database can be used as an effective tool to assess possible streamflow scenarios assuming different rainfall volumes for the following days. The application to the study site shows that magnitudes of real flood events were appropriately captured by the database. Further work should be dedicated to introduce a component for taking account of the actual temporal distribution of rainfall events into the stochastic rainfall generator and to the use of different rainfall-runoff models to enhance the usability of the proposed procedure. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Resumen: un componente importante de la modelaci�n hidrol�gica es la capacidad de simulaci�n hidr�ulica. La simulaci�n adecuada de caudales en ocasiones esta desligada de la simulaci�n de variables hidr�ulicas del flujo las cuales son muy importantes para ciertas aplicaciones. La configuraci�n hidr�ulica de los cauces es un concepto que dif�cilmente puede ser descrito de manera puntual, mas bien es el producto de un conjunto de factores que est�n relacionados con las caracter�sticas longitudinales. En este trabajo se proponen algunas mejoras al componente hidr�ulico del modelo hidrol�gico SHIA propuesta por (V�lez, 2001) las cuales est�n basadas en la caracterizaci�n hidr�ulica de las corrientes por medio de tramos de configuraci�n t�pica y que pueden ser visualizados como un elemento de comportamiento similar en un contexto longitudinal y no puntual. Por otra parte, debido a que en ciertas aplicaciones no se cuenta con la informaci�n necesaria para la modelaci�n distribuida se propone una versi�n por laderas que esta ligada a la caracterizaci�n por tramos de corriente. Adicionalmente se presenta una metodolog�a para clasificar cada unidad de discretizaci�n espacial (celda) en base a la potencia especifica y el �rea de drenaje acumulada. Tambien se asumen algunas consideraciones para la condici�n de flujo por fuera de la banca llena tales como la no linealidad de las variables hidr�ulicas, la remoci�n de part�- culas del lecho y los cambios considerables en la concentraci�n de solidos asociados con los aumentos de velocidad en el flujo. Se realizan aplicaciones para validar las metodolog�as propuestas en cuanto a la estimaci�n de la resistencia al flujo, condiciones por fuera de la banca llena, modelaci�n de flujos hiperconcentrados en forma de flujos de escombros, y cambios en la resoluci�n espacial. Todas las aplicaciones est�n basadas es una asignaci�n previa del tipo de celda y una caracterizaci�n previa de los tramos de corriente.

abstract = {Flash floods represent one of the most destructive natural hazards in the Mediterranean region. These floods result from very intense and spatially heterogeneous rainfall events. Distributed hydrological models are valuable tools to study these phenomena and increase our knowledge on the main processes governing the generation and propagation of floods over large spatial scales. They are generally built using a bottom???up approach that generalizes small-physics representations of processes. However, top???down or data-driven approach is increasingly shown to provide also valuable knowledge. A simplified semi-distributed continuous hydrological model, named SIMPLEFLOOD, was developed, based on the simple dynamical system approach (SDSA) proposed by Kirchner (WRR, 2009, 45, W02429), and applied to the Ard??che catchment in France (2388 km2). This data-driven method assumes that discharge at the outlet of a given catchment can be expressed as a function only of catchment storage. It leads to a 3-parameter nonlinear model according to rainfall and runoff observations. This model was distributed over sub-catchments and coupled with a kinematic wave based flow propagation module. The parameters were estimated by discharge recession analyses at several gauged stations. Parameter regionalization was conducted using a Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Hierarchical Classification on Principal Component (HCPC) in order to find relationships between the SDSA approach and catchments characteristics. Geology was found to be the main predictor of hydrological response variability and model parameters were regionalized according to the dominant geology. The SIMPLEFLOOD model was applied for a 12-year continuous simulation over the Ard??che catchment. Four flash flood events were also selected for further analysis. The simulated hydrographs were compared with the observations at 11 gauging stations with catchment size ranging from 17 to 2300 km2. The results show a good performance of the model for the continuous and flash flood events occurring under wet conditions, whereas the model underestimates discharge for events occurring after a long dry period. The simple modeling approach provided interesting insight into the Ard??che catchment functioning and offers perspective for a better simulation of flash floods, mainly under wet conditions.},

abstract = {Flash flood events are responsible for large economic losses and lead to fatalities every year in France. This is especially the case in the Mediterranean and oversea territories/departments of France, characterized by extreme hydro-climatological features and with a large part of the population exposed to flood risks. The recurrence of remarkable flash flood events, associated with high hazard intensity, significant damage and socio-political consequences, therefore raises several issues for authorities and risk management policies. This study aims to improve our understanding of the hazard analysis process in the case of four remarkable flood events: March 1930, October 1940, January 1980 and November 1999. Firstly, we present the methodology used to define the remarkability score of a flood event. Then, to identify the factors leading to a remarkable flood event, we explore the main parameters of the hazard analysis process, such as the meteorological triggering conditions, the return period of the rainfall and peak discharge, as well as some additional factors (initial catchment state, flood chronology, cascade effects, etc.). The results contribute to understanding the complexity of the processes leading to flood hazard and highlight the importance for risk managers of taking additional factors into account.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the analysis of the 1 October 2009 flash flood and debris flow event caused by a very intense rainfall concentrated over the Messina area. The storm caused severe flash floods in many villages around the city of Messina, such as Giampilieri, Scaletta Zanclea, Altolia Superiore and Molino, with 38 casualties and significant damages to property, buildings, roads and bridges estimated close to 550 million Euro. The main focus of this work is to perform a post event analysis, putting together available meteorological and hydrological data in order to get better insight into temporal and spatial variability of the rain storm, the soil moisture conditions and the consequent flash flood in the Giampilieri catchment. The event was investigated using observed data from a raingauge network. Statistical analysis using GEV distribution was performed and rainfall return period (storm severity) was estimated. Further, measured rainfall data and rainfall-runoff modelling were used to estimate soil moisture conditions, to analyse the hydrological behaviour and to reconstruct flood hydrograph. With the help of GIS technology and particularly spatial analysis, the volume of debris which has gone down into the Giampilieri village was also calculated. GIS maps with landslide and material deposit areas were produced and analysed.},

abstract = {To quantify and model the natural ground water recharge process, six sites located in the midwest and eastern United States where previous water balance observations had been made were compared to computerized techniques to estimate: (1) base flow and (2) ground water recharge. Results from an existing automated digital filter technique for separating baseflow from daily streamflow records were compared to baseflow estimates made in the six water balance studies. Previous validation of automated baseflow separation techniques consisted only of comparisons with manual techniques. In this study, the automated digital filter technique was found to compare well with measured field estimates yielding a monthly coefficient of determination of 0.86. The recharge algorithm developed in this study is an automated derivation of the Rorabaugh hydrograph recession curve displacement method that utilizes daily streamflow. Comparison of annual recharge from field water balance measurements to those computed with the automated recession curve displacement method had coefficients of determination of 0.76 and predictive efficiencies of 71 percent. Monthly estimates showed more variation and are not advocated for use with this method. These techniques appear to be fast, reproducible methods for estimating baseflow and annual recharge and should be useful in regional modeling efforts and as a quick check on mass balance techniques for shallow water table aquifers.},

We start by describing the evolution of the two UNESCO activities (FRIEND and HELP) and the new initiative of the International Association of Hydrologi- cal Sciences (IAHS) called PUB. We then explore possible areas of intersection among FRIEND, HELP and PUB and list the hitherto unrealized opportunities for research that would add value to each programme and, consequently, hydrological sciences and integrated drainage-basin management.

abstract = {The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River. Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013 and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas. Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling (Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering three different scenarios associated with the initial construction (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population. Specific stage???damage functions were expressly developed using in situ data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit value were established. The relationship between water depth and the height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function. Other nonspecific magnitude???damage functions were used in order to compare both economic estimates. The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude???damage functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses, partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well as the types of flood that affect it.},

abstract = {The characterization of the spatial-temporal variability of soil moisture is of paramount importance in many scientific fields and operational applications. However, due to the high variability of soil moisture, its monitoring over large areas and for extended periods through in situ point measurements is not straightforward. Usually, in the scientific literature, soil moisture variability has been investigated over short periods and in large areas or over long periods but in small areas. In this study, an effort to understanding soil moisture variability at catchment scale ({\textgreater}100km 
                        2), which is the size needed for some hydrological applications and for remote sensing validation analysis, is done. Specifically, measurements were carried out in two adjacent areas located in central Italy with extension of 178 and 242km 
                        2 and over a period of 1year (35 sampling days) with almost weekly frequency except for the summer period because of soil hardness. For each area, 46 sites were monitored and, for each site, 3 measurements were performed to obtain reliable soil moisture estimates. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 0-15cm. A statistical and temporal stability analysis is employed to assess the space-time variability of soil moisture at local and catchment scale. Moreover, by comparing the results with those obtained in previous studies conducted in the same study area, a synthesis of soil moisture variability for a range of spatial scales, from few square meters to several square kilometers, is attempted. For the investigated area, the two main findings inferred are: (1) the spatial variability of soil moisture increases with the area up to {\~{}}10km 
                        2 and then remains quite constant with an average coefficient of variation equal to {\~{}}0.20; (2) regardless of the areal extension, the soil moisture exhibits temporal stability features and, hence, few measurements can be used to infer areal mean values with a good accuracy (determination coefficient higher than 0.88). These insights based on in situ soil moisture observations corroborate the opportunity to use point information for the validation of coarse resolution satellite images. Moreover, the feasibility to use coarse resolution data for hydrological applications in small to medium sized catchments is confirmed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Heavy rainstorms often induce flash flooding, one of the natural disasters most responsible for damage to man-made infrastructure and loss of lives, adversely affecting also the opportunities for socio-economic development of Mediterranean Countries. The frequently dramatic damage of flash floods are often detected with sufficient accuracy by post-event surveys, but rainfall causing them are still only roughly characterized. With the aim of improving the understanding of the temporal structure and spatial distribution of heavy rainstorms in the Mediterranean context, a statistical analysis was carried out in Calabria (southern Italy) concerning rainstorms that mainly induced flash floods, but also shallow landslides and debris-flows. Thus a method is proposed – based on the overcoming of heuristically predetermined threshold values of cumulated rainfall, maximum intensity, and kinetic energy of the rainfall event – to select and characterize the rainstorms able to induce flash floods in the Mediterranean-climate Countries. Therefore the obtained (heavy) rainstorms were automatically classified and studied according to their structure in time, localization and extension. Rainfall-runoff watershed models can consequently benefit from the enhanced identification of design storms, with a realistic time structure integrated with the results of the spatial analysis. A survey of flash flood events recorded in the last decades provides a preliminary validation of the method proposed to identify the heavy rainstorms and synthetically describe their characteristics. The notable size of the employed sample, including data with a very detailed resolution in time, that relate to several rain gauges well-distributed throughout the region, give robustness to the obtained results.},

abstract = {In Mediterranean Europe, flash flooding is one of the most devastating hazards in terms of loss of human life and infrastructures. Over the last two decades, flash floods have caused damage costing a billion Euros in France alone. One of the problems of flash floods is that warning times are very short, leaving typically only a few hours for civil protection services to act. This study investigates if operationally available short-range numerical weather forecasts together with a rainfall-runoff model can be used for early indication of the occurrence of flash floods. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} One of the challenges in flash flood forecasting is that the watersheds are typically small, and good observational networks of both rainfall and discharge are rare. Therefore, hydrological models are difficult to calibrate and the simulated river discharges cannot always be compared with ground measurements. The lack of observations in most flash flood prone basins, therefore, necessitates the development of a method where the excess of the simulated discharge above a critical threshold can provide the forecaster with an indication of potential flood hazard in the area, with lead times of the order of weather forecasts. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} This study is focused on the C{\'{e}}vennes-Vivarais region in the Southeast of the Massif Central in France, a region known for devastating flash floods. This paper describes the main aspects of using numerical weather forecasting for flash flood forecasting, together with a threshold – exceedance. As a case study the severe flash flood event which took place on 8–9 September 2002 has been chosen. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Short-range weather forecasts, from the Lokalmodell of the German national weather service, are used as input for the LISFLOOD model, a hybrid between a conceptual and physically based rainfall-runoff model. Results of the study indicate that high resolution operational weather forecasting combined with a rainfall-runoff model could be useful to determine flash floods more than 24 h in advance. },

abstract = {Recession analysis is a well-known tool in hydrological analysis. Its application, however, poses many methodical questions, and throughout the literature numerous solutions have been sought. The quantification of the recession curve involves the selection of an analytical expression, derivation of a characteristic recession and optimization of the recession parameters. A major problem is the high variability encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The segments represent different stages in the outflow process, and a physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession. This paper discusses these elements of recession analysis and reviews different ways of characterizing the baseflow recession rate. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {This study documents the preferred location and diurnal cycle of extreme convective storms that occur in the tropical band containing the east Pacific Ocean, Central and South America, the Atlantic Ocean, and northern Africa. Data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar show three types of convective-stratiform structures that constitute extreme convective events: deep convective cores (DCCs), wide convective cores (WCCs), and broad stratiform regions (BSRs). Interim ECMWF Re- Analysis (ERA-Interim) data show the associated synoptic environmental factors associated with the oc- currence of extreme convective features. The DCC, WCC, and BSRechoes are associated with early, middle, and late stages of convective system development, respectively, and the statistics and timing of their occur- rence are related to topography and life cycle behavior of the convection. Storms containing DCC occur primarily over the Sudanian savannas of Africa and near the mountains in northern South America, being diurnally controlled. Storms with WCC manifest over land, in the same regions as the DCC, but also over oceanic regions. They appear around the clock but with maximum frequency at night. They are favored in regions of midlevel synoptic-scale low pressure systems, which over the sub-Sahara are the troughs of easterly waves. Storms containing BSR maximize over oceanic regions west of Africa and South America, where they exhibit a weak diurnal cycle with a slight midmorning maximum. Off the west coast of South America, the storms withWCCand BSR have longer lifetimes enhanced by orographic lifting over the Andes. The storms with BSR in the east Pacific Ocean often develop into tropical cyclones. 1.},

abstract = {Methodologies for developing a macro-scale model of subsurface stormflow generation on a steep forested catchment in Japan are addressed. Field studies on this catchment have indicated that subsurface flow, consisting mainly of 'old' water displaced by 'new' rain water, dominates the storm response. Detailed field measurements on the catchment allowed simple, catchment-scale relationships to be developed between the volume of saturated groundwater, on the one hand, and discharge, and surface and subsurface saturated areas, on the other. Attempts are made to find linkages between these empirical relationships and physically-based descriptions of hydrological processes operating at smaller scales. A distributed model based on the saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow on steep catchments was developed and tested with field data collected on this catchment. Derivation of catchment-scale relationships can be carried out by a straightforward integration of the distributed model output. An alternative disaggregation-aggregation approach is presented, whereby the catchment is divided into a number of hillslope flow strips. By applying the distributed model on each flow strip, under steady-state conditions, it is possible to infer the spatial variability of groundwater volume in the various flow strips. This variability is related to a measure of hillslope topography and geometry. Knowing the catch-ment topography and geometry for any catchment, it is then possible to derive useful catchment-scale relationships which are applicable under quasi-steady-state conditions, Hydrological relationships derived in this manner are compared with corresponding empirical relationships. The methodologies presented are effective for understanding the linkages between catchment scale response and small-scale flow processes.},

Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) product was evaluated with the rain gauge network at monthly and daily time-scales considering various time periods and rainfall rate thresholds. Statistical analysis indicated that GSMaP shows acceptable linear correlation coefficient with rain gauges however suffers from significant underestimation bias. A rainfall rate threshold of 1 mm/month was the best choice to improve the match between GSMaP and rain gauges implying that appropriate threshold selection is critically important for the bias correction. Multiplicative bias correction was applied to GSMaP data using the bias factors calculated between GSMaP and observed rainfall. Hydrological River Basin Environmental Assessment Model (Hydro-BEAM) was used to simulate flash floods at the hourly time scale driven by the corrected GSMaP rainfall data. The model parameters were calibrated for flash flood events during October-December 2007 and then validated for flash flood events during October-December 2009. The results show that the simulated surface runoff hydrographs reasonably coincide with the observed hydrographs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Rainfall-runoff models are crucial tools for the statistical prediction of ﬂash ﬂoods and real-time forecasting. This paper focuses on a karstic basin in the South of France and proposes a distributed parsimonious event-based rainfall-runoff model, coherent with the poor knowledge of both evaporative and underground ﬂuxes. The model combines a SCS runoff model and a Lag and Route routing model for each cell of a regular grid mesh. The efﬁciency of the model is discussed not only to satisfactorily simulate ﬂoods but also to get powerful relationships between the initial condition of the model and various predictors of the initial wetness state of the basin, such as the base ﬂow, the Hu2 index from the Meteo-France SIM model and the piezometric levels of the aquifer. The advantage of using meteorological radar rainfall in ﬂood modelling is also assessed. Model calibration proved to be satisfactory by using an hourly time step with Nash criterion values, ranging between 0.66 and 0.94 for eighteen of the twenty-one selected events. The radar rainfall inputs signiﬁcantly improved the simulations or the assessment of the initial condition of the model for 5 events at the beginning of autumn, mostly in September–October (mean improvement of Nash is 0.09; correction in the initial condition ranges from −205 to 124 mm), but were less efﬁ- cient for the events at the end of autumn. In this period, the weak vertical extension of the precipitation system and the low altitude of the 0 ◦ C isotherm could affect the efﬁciency of radar measurements due to the distance between the basin and the radar (∼60 km). The model initial condition S is correlated with the three tested predictors (R 2 {\textgreater} 0.6). The interpretation of the model suggests that groundwater does not affect the ﬁrst peaks of the ﬂood, but can strongly impact subsequent peaks in the case of a multi-storm event. Because this kind of model is based on a limited amount of readily available data, it should be suitable for operational applications.},

abstract = {The analysis of Henderson and Wooding, 1964, is expanded in comparing simplified models of subsurface stormflow for the case of a sloping soil mantle in which the hydraulic conductivity is constant throughout. Reviewing studies both in the field and theoretical in nature, the process of subsurface stormflow apparently will be the dominant mode of hydrological response of a hillslope or catchment under the following conditions: soils of high permeability, whether inherent in the soil matrix or due to structural or biotic macropores; and a steep hydraulic gradient, whether due to the slope of hillslopes or to the buildup of groundwater mounds on shallow slopes. The magnitude and timing of the subsurface flow response will depend on the depth and hydraulic conditions of the unsaturated zone at the time of the storm. In this paper only the simplest possible conditions have been studied, with the unsaturated zone being neglected, and constant input to a soil of constant hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity throughout its depth being assumed. It has been shown using data from field and numerical studies of subsurface stormflow that the kinematic approximation may be appropriate for combinations of slope conditions and input rates of practical interest.

abstract = {A regional study of snow avalanche processes was undertaken in the SE Pyrenees. Dendrogeomorphology was used to date and reconstruct large-scale snow avalanche events that occurred in the last four decades. Dendrochronological analyses yielded the dates of nine winters when avalanches occurred in the recent past in six studied avalanche paths. Some of these avalanches were already known, but others had not been documented. In one case, the existing avalanche path map was improved with the dendrogeomorphological information of a larger past event. As a result of the dendrogeomorphological analyses, evidence for three regional-scale major avalanche years was identified in the SE Pyrenees from 1971 to 2004: 1971-1972, 1995-1996 and 2002-2003. The specific synoptic atmospheric situations and the most likely nivometeorological and snowpack conditions that released these major avalanches were determined using weather data for the seasons of major avalanche releases. In 1971-1972 the snow avalanche episode was characterized by a deep trough crossing the Pyrenees. In 1995-1996 a variety of meteorological situations produced several episodes of major avalanches. In 2002-2003 the more significant of two episodes was attributed to a north advection pumping an arctic air mass over the Pyrenees. The 1995-1996 avalanche season proved to be the most notable in the four past decades in the Pyrenees.},

abstract = {The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River. Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013 and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas. Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling (Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering three different scenarios associated with the initial construction (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population. Specific stage–damage functions were expressly developed using in situ data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit value were established. The relationship between water depth and the height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function. Other nonspecific magnitude–damage functions were used in order to compare both economic estimates. The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude–damage functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses, partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well as the types of flood that affect it.},

abstract = {This contribution is one of the first studies about the regionalization of parameter sets for a rainfall-runoff model process-oriented and dedicated to flash floods. MARINE model performances are tested on a large database of 117 flash floods occurred during the last two decades in the French Mediterranean region. Given the scarcity of flash flood data, the dataset used in this study represents a large sample of hydrology and landscapes from Pyrenean, Mediterranean, C??vennes-Vivarais and Provence regions. Spatial proximity and similarity approaches with several combinations of descriptors are tested. Encouraging results are obtained with two similarity approaches based on physiographic descriptors with two and three donor catchments. There is only a small decrease of performance of 10{\%} from cal/val to regionalization for these two methods. For 13 catchments out of 16 there is at least one flood event simulated with rather good performance. This study highlights the importance of hydrological information that is available in calibration events for a gauged catchment and from donor catchment(s) for regionalization. Moreover it is found that regionalization is easier for catchments with an apparently more regular behaviour. The most sensitive parameter of MARINE model, C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}Z{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, controlling soil volume and water balance, is rather well constrained by the two similarity approaches thanks to bedrock descriptors.},

abstract = {Semiarid flash floods pose a significant danger for life and property in many dry regions around the world. One effective way to mitigate flood risk lies in implementing a real-time forecast and warning system based on a rainfall-runoff model. This study used a semiarid, physics-based, and spatially distributed watershed model driven by high-resolution radar rainfall input to evaluate such a system. The predictive utility of the model and dominant sources of uncertainty were investigated for several runoff events within the U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed located in the southwestern United States. Sources of uncertainty considered were rainfall estimates, watershed model parameters, and initial soil moisture conditions. Results derived through a variance-based comprehensive global sensitivity analysis indicated that the high predictive uncertainty in the modeled response was heavily dominated by biases in the radar rainfall depth estimates. Key model parameters and initial model states were identified, and we generally found that modeled hillslope characteristics are more influential than channel characteristics in small semiarid basins. We also observed an inconsistency in the parameter sets identified as behavioral for different events, which suggests that model calibration to historical data is unlikely to consistently improve predictive performance for different events and that real-time parameter updating may be preferable.},

abstract = {Landslides are a main cause of human and economic losses worldwide. For this reason, landslide hazard assessment and the capacity to predict this phenomenon have been topics of great interest within the scientific community for the implementation of early warning systems. Although several models have been proposed to forecast shallow landslides triggered by rainfall, few models have incorporated geotechnical factors into a complete hydrological model of a basin that can simulate the storage and movement of rainwater through the soil profile. These basin and full hydrological models have adopted a physically based approach. This paper develops a conceptual and physically based model called open and distributed hydrological simulation and landslides—SHIA{\_}Landslide (Simulaci{\'{o}}n HIdrol{\'{o}}gica Abierta, or SHIA, in Spanish)—that is supported by geotechnical and hydrological features occurring on a basin-wide scale in tropical and mountainous terrains. SHIA{\_}Landslide is an original and significant contribution that offers a new perspective with which to analyse shallow landslide processes by incorporating a comprehensive distributed hydrological tank model that includes water storage in the soil coupled with a classical analysis of infinite slope stability under saturated conditions. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be distinguished by the following: (i) its capacity to capture surface topography and effects concerning the subsurface flow; (ii) its use of digital terrain model (DTM) to establish the relationships among cells, geomorphological parameters, slope angle, direction, etc.; (iii) its continuous simulation of rainfall data over long periods and event simulations of specific storms; (iv) its consideration of the effects of horizontal and vertical flow; and (vi) its inclusion of a hydrologically complete water process that allows for hydrological calibration. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be combined with real-time rainfall data and implemented in early warning systems.},

abstract = {Predictions in ungauged basins have been a major challenge in hydrologic sciences, and there is still much work needed to achieve robust and reliable predictions for such basins. Here, we propose and test a novel approach for predicting runoff from poorly gauged basins using a minimum complex model calibrated with isotope data alone (i.e., without observed discharge data). The model is composed of two water-stores (soil water and groundwater) and considers their connectivity to runoff in terms of both water and isotope budgets. In a meso-scale basin in which riverbed deformations frequently occur, making automatic observation of river discharge difficult, we measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition ($\delta$2H and $\delta$18O) of precipitation and river water twice-weekly for one year. Runoff predicted by the model agreed well with that observed monthly or bimonthly. Monte Carlo simulation revealed a strong coherence between model performance in isotope simulation and runoff prediction, demonstrating that the use of isotopes as dynamic proxies of calibration targets helps reliably constrain model parameters. Our results indicate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for prediction of runoff hydrographs, particularly for basins in which the stage-discharge relationship is highly variable.},

abstract = {Just as with the storms that cause them, flash floods are highly variable and non-linear phenomena in both time and space; hence understanding and anticipating the genesis of flash floods is far from straightforward. There is therefore a huge requirement for tools with the potential to provide advance warning of situations likely to lead to flash floods, and thus provide additional time for the flood forecasting services. The Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) method is used on US catchments to estimate the average number of inches of rainfall for given durations required to produce flash flooding. This rainfall amount is used afterwards as a flood warning threshold. In Europe, flash floods often occur on small catchments (approximately 100 km2) and it has already been shown that the spatial variability of rainfall has a great impact on the catchment response (Le Lay and Saulnier, 2007). Therefore, in this study, an improved FFG method which accounts for rainfall spatial variability is proposed. The objectives of this paper are (i) to assess the FFG method applicability on French Mediterranean catchments with a distributed process-oriented hydrological model and (ii) to assess the effect of the rainfall spatial variability on this method. The results confirm the influence of the spatial variability of rainfall events in relation with its interaction with soil properties.},

abstract = {In northern Morocco are located most of the dams and reservoirs of the country, while this region is affected by severe rainfall events causing floods. To improve the management of the water regulation structures, there is a need to develop rainfall-runoff models to both maximize the storage capacity and reduce the risks caused by floods. In this study, a model is developed to reproduce the flood events for a 655 km2 catchment located upstream of the 6th largest dam in Morocco. Constrained by data availability, a standard event-based model combining a SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service Curve Number) loss model and a Clark unit hydrograph was developed for hourly discharge simulation using 16 flood events that occurred between 1984 and 2008. The model was found satisfactory to reproduce the runoff and the temporal evolution of floods, even with limited rainfall data. Several antecedent wetness conditions estimators for the catchment were compared with the initial condition of the model. Theses estimators include an antecedent discharge index, an antecedent precipitation index and a continuous daily soil moisture accounting model (SMA), based on precipitation and evapotranspiration. The SMA model performed the best to estimate the initial conditions of the event-based hydrological model (R2 Combining double low line 0.9). Its daily output has been compared with ASCAT and AMSR-E remote sensing data products, which were both able to reproduce with accuracy the daily simulated soil moisture dynamics at the catchment scale. This same approach could be implemented in other catchments of this region for operational purposes. The Results of this study suggest that remote sensing data are potentially useful to estimate the soil moisture conditions in the case of ungauged catchments in Northern Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {Flash flooding is one of the most costly and deadly natural hazards in the United States and across the globe. This study advances the use of high-resolution quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) for flash flood forecasting. The QPFs are derived from a stormscale ensemble prediction system, and used within a distributed hydrological model framework to yield basin-specific, probabilistic flash flood forecasts (PFFFs). Before creating the PFFFs, it is important to characterize QPF uncertainty, particularly in terms of location which is the most problematic for hydrological use of QPFs. The SAL methodology (Wernli et al., 2008), which stands for structure, amplitude, and location, is used for this error quantification, with a focus on location. Finally, the PFFF methodology is proposed that produces probabilistic hydrological forecasts. The main advantages of this method are: (1) identifying specific basin scales that are forecast to be impacted by flash flooding; (2) yielding probabilistic information about the forecast hydrologic response that accounts for the locational uncertainties of the QPFs; (3) improving lead time by using stormscale NWP ensemble forecasts; and (4) not requiring multiple simulations, which are computationally demanding.},

abstract = {In this paper we review threshold behaviour in environmental systems, which are often associated with the onset of floods, contamination and erosion events, and other degenerative processes. Key objectives of this review are to a) suggest indicators for detecting threshold behavior, b) discuss their implications for predictability, c) distinguish different forms of threshold behavior and their underlying controls, and d) hypothesise on possible reasons for why threshold behaviour might occur. Threshold behaviour involves a fast qualitative change of either a single process or the response of a system. For elementary phenomena this switch occurs when boundary conditions (e.g., energy inputs) or system states as expressed by dimensionless quantities (e.g. the Reynolds number) exceed threshold values. Mixing, water movement or depletion of thermodynamic gradients becomes much more efficient as a result. Intermittency is a very good indicator for detecting event scale threshold behavior in hydrological systems. Predictability of intermittent processes/system responses is inherently low for combinations of systems states and/or boundary conditions that push the system close to a threshold. Post hoc identification of `cause-effect relations' to explain when the system became critical is inherently difficult because of our limited ability to perform observations under controlled identical experimental conditions. In this review, we distinguish three forms of threshold behavior. The first one is threshold behavior at the process level that is controlled by the interplay of local soil characteristics and states, vegetation and the rainfall forcing. Overland flow formation, particle detachment and preferential flow are examples of this. The second form of threshold behaviour is the response of systems of intermediate complexity - e.g., catchment runoff response and sediment yield - governed by the redistribution of water and sediments in space and time. These are controlled by the topological architecture of the catchments that interacts with system states and the boundary conditions. Crossing the response thresholds means to establish connectedness of surface or subsurface flow paths to the catchment outlet. Subsurface stormflow in humid areas, overland flow and erosion in semi-arid and arid areas are examples, and explain that crossing local process thresholds is necessary but not sufficient to trigger a system response threshold. The third form of threshold behaviour involves changes in the `architecture' of human geo-ecosystems, which experience various disturbances. As a result substantial change in hydrological functioning of a system is induced, when the disturbances exceed the resilience of the geo-ecosystem. We present examples from savannah ecosystems, humid agricultural systems, mining activities affecting rainfall runoff in forested areas, badlands formation in Spain, and the restoration of the Upper Rhine river basin as examples of this phenomenon. This functional threshold behaviour is most difficult to predict, since it requires extrapolations far away from our usual experience and the accounting of bidirectional feedbacks. However, it does not require the development of more complicated model, but on the contrary, only models with the right level of simplification, which we illustrate with an instructive example. Following Prigogine, who studied structure formation in open thermodynamic systems, we hypothesise that topological structures which control response thresholds in the landscape might be seen as dissipative structures, nd the onset of threshold processes/response as a switch to more efficient ways of depleting strong gradients that develop in the case of extreme boundary conditions.},

The potential of an artificial neural network to perform simple non-linear hydrological transformations un- der controlled conditions is examined in this paper. Eight neural network models were developed: four full or partial emulations of a recognised non-linear hydrological rainfall- runoff model; four solutions developed on an identical set of inputs and a calculated runoff coefficient output. The use of different input combinations enabled the competencies of solutions developed on a reduced number of parameters to be assessed. The selected hydrological model had a limited number of inputs and contained no temporal component. The modelling process was based on a set of random inputs that had a uniform distribution and spanned a modest range of possibilities. The initial cloning operations permitted a direct comparison to be performed with the equation-based rela- tionship. It also provided more general information about the power of a neural network to replicate mathematical equa- tions and model modest non-linear relationships. The sec- ond group of experiments explored a different relationship that is of hydrological interest; the target surface contained a stronger set of non-linear properties and was more challeng- ing. Linear modelling comparisons were performed against traditional least squares multiple linear regression solutions developed on identical datasets.

abstract = {The contribution of rainfall forcing errors relative to model (structural and parameter) uncertainty in the prediction of soil moisture is investigated by integrating the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM), forced with hydro-meteorological data, in the Oklahoma region. Rainfall-forcing uncertainty is introduced using a stochastic error model that generates ensemble rainfall fields from satellite rainfall products. The ensemble satellite rain fields are propagated through CLSM to produce soil moisture ensembles. Errors in CLSM are modeled with two different approaches: either by perturbing model parameters (representing model parameter uncertainty) or by adding randomly generated noise (representing model structure and parameter uncertainty) to the model prognostic variables. Our findings highlight that the method currently used in the NASA GEOS-5 Land Data Assimilation System to perturb CLSM variables poorly describes the uncertainty in the predicted soil moisture, even when combined with rainfall model perturbations. On the other hand, by adding model parameter perturbations to rainfall forcing perturbations, a better characterization of uncertainty in soil moisture simulations is observed. Specifically, an analysis of the rank histograms shows that the most consistent ensemble of soil moisture is obtained by combining rainfall and model parameter perturbations. When rainfall forcing and model prognostic perturbations are added, the rank histogram shows a U-shape at the domain average scale, which corresponds to a lack of variability in the forecast ensemble. The more accurate estimation of the soil moisture prediction uncertainty obtained by combining rainfall and parameter perturbations is encouraging for the application of this approach in ensemble data assimilation systems.},

The investigation was carried out for an actual catchment topography as represented by Coweeta River experimental basin with synthetic realizations for rainfall and soils. The hydrologic response of this catchment was modeled by a modified version of topmodel{\{}black star{\}} {\{}black star{\}} Beven and Kirkby (1979) which is capable of modeling both infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff and incorporating the spatial variability of soils, topography, and rainfall. The effect of scale was analyzed by first dividing the catchment into smaller subcatchments and determining the average water fluxes for each subcatchment. The preliminary results lead to the following conclusions: (1) a Representative Elementary Area (REA) exists in the context of catchment hydrologic responses; (2) the REA is strongly influenced by the topography; and (3) based on our initial results, the length scale of rainfall seems to have only a secondary role in determining the size of the REA; however, increases in the variability of rainfall and soils between subcatchments increase the variability of runoff generation between subcatchments. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {This study explores various aspects of catchment hydrology based on a mechanistic modeling of distributed watershed processes. A new physics-based, distributed-parameter hydrological model that uses an irregular spatial discretization is introduced. The model accounts, on a continuous basis, for the processes of rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, moisture dynamics in the unsaturated and saturated zones, and runoff routing. Simulations of several mid- to large-sized watersheds ( 10 3 km2) highlight various dynamic relationships between the vadose zone -- groundwater processes and their dependence on the land surface characteristics. It is argued that the model inferences can be used for interpretation of distributed relationships in a catchment. By exploiting a multiple-resolution representation, the hydrologic features of the watershed terrain are captured with only 5 -- 10{\%} of the original grid nodes. This computational efficiency suggests the feasibility of the operational use of fully distributed, physics-based models for large watersheds.},

In this paper we revisit key modeling challenges, outlined by Freeze and Harlan nearly 50 years ago, on requirements to (1) define suitable model equations, (2) define adequate model parameters, and (3) cope with limitations in computing power. We outline the historical modeling challenges, summarize modeling advances that address these challenges, and define outstanding research needs. We illustrate how modeling advances have been made by groups using models of different type and complexity, and we argue for the need to more effectively use our diversity of modeling approaches in order to advance our collective quest for physically realistic hydrologic models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Paniconi2003,
abstract = {Hillslope response to rainfall remains one of the central problems of catchment hydrology. Flow processes in a one-dimensional sloping aquifer can be described by Boussinesq's hydraulic groundwater theory. Most hillslopes, however, have complex three-dimensional shapes that are characterized by their plan shape, profile curvature of surface and bedrock, and the soil depth. Field studies and numerical simulation have shown that these attributes are the most significant topographic controls on subsurface flow and saturation along hillslopes. In this paper the Boussinesq equation is reformulated in terms of soil water storage rather than water table height. The continuity and Darcy equations formulated in terms of storage along the hillslope lead to the hillslope-storage Boussinesq (HSB) equation for subsurface flow. Solutions of the HSB equation account explicitly for plan shape of the hillslope by introducing the hillslope width function and for profile curvature through the bedrock slope angle and the hillslope soil depth function. We investigate the behavior of the HSB model for different hillslope types (uniform, convergent, and divergent) and different slope angles under free drainage conditions after partial initial saturation (drainage scenario) and under constant rainfall recharge conditions (recharge scenario). The HSB equation is solved by means of numerical integration of the partial differential equation. We find that convergent hillslopes drain much more slowly compared to divergent hillslopes. The accumulation of moisture storage near the outlet of convergent hillslopes results in bell-shaped hydrographs. In contrast, the fast draining divergent hillslopes produce highly peaked hydrographs. In order to investigate the relative importance of the different terms in the HSB equation, several simplified nonlinear and linearized versions are derived, for instance, by recognizing that the width function of a hillslope generally shows smooth transition along the flow direction or by introducing a fitting parameter to account for average storage along the hillslope. The dynamic response of these reduced versions of the HSB equation under free drainage conditions depend strongly on hillslope shape and bedrock slope angle. For flat slopes (of the order of 5{\%}), only the simplified nonlinear HSB equation is able to capture the dynamics of subsurface flow along complex hillslopes. In contrast, for steep slopes (of the order of 30{\%}), we see that all the reduced versions show very similar results compared to the full version. It can be concluded that the complex derivative terms of width with respect to flow distance play a less dominant role with increasing slope angle. Comparison with the hillslope-storage kinematic wave model of Troch et al. [2002] shows that the diffusive drainage terms of the HSB model become less important for the fast draining divergent hillslopes. These results have important implications for the use of simplified versions of the HSB equation in landscapes and for the development of appropriate analytical solutions for subsurface flow along complex hillslopes.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a flexible framework for conceptual hydrological modeling, with two related objectives: (1) generalize and systematize the currently fragmented field of conceptual models and (2) provide a robust platform for understanding and modeling hydrological systems. In contrast to currently dominant ‘‘fixed'' model applications, the flexible framework proposed here allows the hydrologist to hypothesize, build, and test different model structures using combinations of generic components. This is particularly useful for conceptual modeling at the catchment scale, where limitations in process understanding and data availability remain major research and operational challenges. The formulation of the model architecture and individual components to represent distinct aspects of catchment-scale function, such as storage, release, and transmission of water, is discussed. Several numerical strategies for implementing the model equations within a computationally robust framework are also presented. In the companion paper, the potential of the flexible framework is examined with respect to supporting more systematic and stringent hypothesis testing, for characterizing catchment diversity, and, more generally, for aiding progress toward more unified hydrological theory at the catchment scale.},

abstract = {The paper forms the first part of an introduction to the SHE, a physically-based, distributed, catchment modelling system produced jointly by the Danish Hydraulic Institute, the British Institute of Hydrology and SOGREAH (France) with the financial support of the Commission of the European Communities. The SHE developed from the perception that conventional rainfall/runoff models are inappropriate to many pressing hydrological problems, especially those related to the impact of man's activities on land-use change and water quality. Only through the use of models which have a physical basis and allow for spatial variations within a catchment can these problems be tackled. The physical basis and flexible operating structure of the SHE allows the model to use as many or as few data as are available and also to incorporate data on topography, vegetation and soil properties not normally included in catchment models. It does not require a lengthy hydrometeorological record for its calibration and its distributed nature enables the spatial variability in catchment inputs and outputs to be simulated. However, the large amount of data required by the model means that new operation methodologies must be evolved. Thus spatial scale effects or simply a lack of data may create significant uncertainties in the values of the catchment parameters used in a simulation. These uncertainties will give rise to corresponding uncertainties in the predictions. However, the SHE is able to quantify these uncertainties by carrying out sensitivity analyses for realistic ranges of the parameter values. Even when there is a lack of data, therefore, the SHE can act as a valuable "decision-support system". {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {Hydrological scientists develop perceptual models of the catchments they study, using field measurements and observations to build an understanding of the dominant processes controlling the hydrological response. However, conceptual and numerical models used to simulate catchment behaviour often fail to take advantage of this knowledge. It is common instead to use a pre-defined model structure which can only be fitted to the catchment via parameter calibration. In this article, we suggest an alternative approach where different sources of field data are used to build a synthesis of dominant hydrological processes and hence provide recommendations for representing those processes in a time-stepping simulation model. Using analysis of precipitation, flow and soil moisture data, recommendations are made for a comprehensive set of modelling decisions, including Evapotranspiration (ET) parameterization, vertical drainage threshold and behaviour, depth and water holding capacity of the active soil zone, unsaturated and saturated zone model architecture and deep groundwater flow behaviour. The second article in this two-part series implements those recommendations and tests the capability of different model sub-components to represent the observed hydrological processes.},

abstract = {Spatial interpolation of precipitation data is of great importance for hydrological modelling. Geostatistical methods (kriging) are widely applied in spatial interpolation from point measurement to continuous surfaces. The first step in kriging computation is the semi-variogram modelling which usually used only one variogram model for all-moment data. The objective of this paper was to develop different algorithms of spatial interpolation for daily rainfall on 1 km² regular grids in the catchment area and to compare the results of geostatistical and deterministic approaches. This study leaned on 30-yr daily rainfall data of 70 raingages in the hilly landscape of the Ourthe and Ambleve catchments in Belgium (2908 km²). This area lies between 35 and 693m in elevation and consists of river net- works, which are tributaries of the Meuse River. For geostatistical algorithms, seven semi-variogram models (logarithmic, power, exponential, Gaussian, rational quadratic, spherical and penta-spherical) were fitted to daily sample semi-variogram on a daily basis. These seven variogram models were also adopted to avoid negative interpolated rainfall. The elevation, extracted from a digital elevation model, was incorporated into multivariate geostatistics. Seven validation raingages and cross validation were used to compare the interpolation performance of these algorithms applied to different densities of raingages. We found that between the seven variogram models used, the Gaussian model was the most frequently best fit. Using seven variogram models can avoid negative daily rainfall in ordinary kriging. The negative estimates of kriging were observed for convective more than stratiform rain. The performance of the different methods varied slightly according to the density of raingages, particularly between 8 and 70 raingages but it was much different for interpolation using 4 raingages. Spatial interpolation with the geostatistical and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) algorithms outperformed considerably the interpolation with the Thiessen polygon, commonly used in various hydrological models. Integrating elevation into Kriging with an External Drift (KED) and Ordinary Cokriging (OCK) did not improve the interpolation accuracy for daily rainfall. Ordinary Kriging (ORK) and IDWwere considered to be the best methods, as they provided smallest RMSE value for nearly all cases. Care should be taken in applying UNK and KED when interpolating daily rainfall with very few neighbourhood sample points. These recommendations complement the results reported in the literature. ORK, UNK and KED using only spherical model offered a slightly better result whereas OCK using seven variogram models achieved better result.

abstract = {Field studies in watershed hydrology continue to characterize and catalogue the enormous heterogeneity and complexity of rainfall runoff processes in more and more watersheds, in different hydroclimatic regimes, and at different scales. Nevertheless, the ability to generalize these findings to ungauged regions remains out of reach. In spite of their apparent physical basis and complexity, the current generation of detailed models is process weak. Their representations of the internal states and process dynamics are still at odds with many experimental findings. In order to make continued progress in watershed hydrology and to bring greater coherence to the science, we need to move beyond the status quo of having to explicitly characterize or prescribe landscape heterogeneity in our (highly calibrated) models and in this way reproduce process complexity and instead explore the set of organizing principles that might underlie the heterogeneity and complexity. This commentary addresses a number of related new avenues for research in watershed science, including the use of comparative analysis, classification, optimality principles, and network theory, all with the intent of defining, understanding, and predicting watershed function and enunciating important watershed functional traits.},

Low runoff ratios were likely related to the$\backslash$nresponse of the riparian zone, which was almost always close to$\backslash$nsaturation. High runoff ratios occurred during wet antecedent$\backslash$nconditions, when the soil moisture threshold was exceeded.

abstract = {This study uses a long-term (8years) dataset of radar-rainfall and runoff observations for the Tar River Basin in North Carolina, to explore the rainfall space-time organization control on the flood response of mild-slope (max slope {\textless}32 degrees) basins. We employ the concepts of "spatial moments of catchment rainfall" and "catchment scale storm velocity" to quantify the effect of spatial rainfall variability and basin geomorphology on flood response. A calibrated distributed hydrologic model is employed to assess the relevance of these statistics in describing the degree of spatial rainfall organization, which is important for runoff modeling. Furthermore, the Tar River Basin is divided into four nested sub-basins ranging from 1106km2 to 5654km2, in order to investigate the scale dependence of results. The rainfall spatiotemporal distribution represented in the analytical framework is shown to describe well the differences in hydrograph timing (less so in terms of magnitude of the simulated hydrographs) determined from forcing the hydrologic model with lumped vs. distributed rainfall. Specifically, the first moment exhibits a linear relationship with the difference in timing between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing. The analysis shows that the catchment scale storm velocity is scale dependent in terms of variability and rainfall dependent in terms of its value, assuming typically small values. Accordingly, the error in dispersion of simulated hydrographs between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing is relatively insensitive to the catchment scale storm velocity, which is attributed to the spatial variability of routing and hillslope velocities that is not accounted by the conceptual framework used in this study. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Rainfall-runoff models are crucial tools for the statistical prediction of ﬂash ﬂoods and real-time forecasting. This paper focuses on a karstic basin in the South of France and proposes a distributed parsimonious event-based rainfall-runoff model, coherent with the poor knowledge of both evaporative and underground ﬂuxes. The model combines a SCS runoff model and a Lag and Route routing model for each cell of a regular grid mesh. The efﬁciency of the model is discussed not only to satisfactorily simulate ﬂoods but also to get powerful relationships between the initial condition of the model and various predictors of the initial wetness state of the basin, such as the base ﬂow, the Hu2 index from the Meteo-France SIM model and the piezometric levels of the aquifer. The advantage of using meteorological radar rainfall in ﬂood modelling is also assessed. Model calibration proved to be satisfactory by using an hourly time step with Nash criterion values, ranging between 0.66 and 0.94 for eighteen of the twenty-one selected events. The radar rainfall inputs signiﬁcantly improved the simulations or the assessment of the initial condition of the model for 5 events at the beginning of autumn, mostly in September–October (mean improvement of Nash is 0.09; correction in the initial condition ranges from −205 to 124 mm), but were less efﬁ- cient for the events at the end of autumn. In this period, the weak vertical extension of the precipitation system and the low altitude of the 0 ◦ C isotherm could affect the efﬁciency of radar measurements due to the distance between the basin and the radar (∼60 km). The model initial condition S is correlated with the three tested predictors (R 2 {\textgreater} 0.6). The interpretation of the model suggests that groundwater does not affect the ﬁrst peaks of the ﬂood, but can strongly impact subsequent peaks in the case of a multi-storm event. Because this kind of model is based on a limited amount of readily available data, it should be suitable for operational applications.},

abstract = {Shallow landslides usually occur during hevy rainfall and result in casualties and property losses. Thus, the possible locations where landslides are likely to occur must be identified in advance in order to avoid or reduce the harm they cause. When performing a slope-instability analysis, soil thickness is an important factor; however, soil thickness information from landslide-prone areas is rarely obtained. The objective of this study is to realize the influences of spatial distribution of soil thickness on shallow landslide prediction. Three different spatial soil-thickness distributions were applied to perform a slope-instability analysis, and uniform-distributed soil thicknesses from 0.4. m to 2.0. m were also applied for comparison. Geomorphologic information and hydrological records from a landslide-prone area in southern Taiwan were collected. Results show that the spatial distribution of soil thickness related to wetness index provides a reasonable estimation in order to avoid an over-prediction for landslide-prone areas or an under-prediction for stable areas. The analytical procedure used in this study is a simple way for assessing hillslope instability for shallow landslide prediction. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The cumulative impacts of urban land use change on natural stream flow regimes and lotic ecosystems are poorly understood, and generally under-studied within the hydrologic sciences literature. Moreover, flow assessments using daily or monthly flows cannot adequately characterize long-term trends in event-scale flow dynamics in urbanizing watersheds. Accordingly, we analyzed high temporal resolution (15-min flows) growing season discharge records for two urbanizing watersheds in Canada's Great Lakes Basin, the Don and Humber, over a 42-year period. Results show that total discharge between May 26th and November 15th in the mainstem rivers has increased by about 45{\%}, independent of total rainfall depth, over four decades. Peak rain event flow rates have increased by almost 0.1m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in both watersheds and event flow variability has increased two-fold in the Don and almost five-fold in the Humber. In the Don, the ratio of rising limb event flows to median flow (for the period May 26 to November 15) increased from 1.5 in the 1970's to 2.3 in the 2000's. A similar comparison of ratios in the Humber showed similar results, with higher variation in flow response Rising limb event flow acceleration increased 2-fold over 4 decades in the Don and slightly more in the Humber. This study provides a new understanding of the changes in event-scale flow regime dynamics associated with over four decades of intensive urbanization, including increased magnitude of rising limb flows and flow acceleration, and systematic increases in the variability of peak discharges. Overall, our analysis demonstrates marked alteration in total and event flow regimes resulting in chronic perturbation of stream flows. The results demonstrate an important application of long-term, high temporal resolution hydrological records. Furthermore, we quantify the degree to which hydrologic stationarity within the Don and Humber watersheds has been compromised over four decades, during a period prior to detectable climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns.},

abstract = {Satellite rainfall products (SRPs) are becoming more accurate with ever increasing spatial and temporal resolution. This evolution can be beneficial for hydrological applications, providing new sources of information and allowing to drive models in ungauged areas. Despite the large availability of rainfall satellite data, their use in rainfall-runoff modelling is still very scarce, most likely due to measurement issues (bias, accuracy) and the hydrological community acceptability of satellite products. In this study, the real-time version (3B42-RT) of Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis, TMPA, and a new SRP based on the application of SM2RAIN algorithm (Brocca et al., 2014) to the ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) soil moisture product, SM2RASC, are used to drive a lumped hydrologic model over four basins in Italy during the 4-year period 2010???2013. The need of the recalibration of model parameter values for each SRP is highlighted, being an important precondition for their suitable use in flood modelling. Results shows that SRPs provided, in most of the cases, performance scores only slightly lower than those obtained by using observed data with a reduction of Nash???Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) less than 30{\%} when using SM2RASC product while TMPA is characterized by a significant deterioration during the validation period 2012???2013. Moreover, the integration between observed and satellite rainfall data is investigated as well. Interestingly, the simple integration procedure here applied allows obtaining more accurate rainfall input datasets with respect to the use of ground observations only, for 3 out 4 basins. Indeed, discharge simulations improve when ground rainfall observations and SM2RASC product are integrated, with an increase of NS between 2 and 42{\%} for the 3 basins in Central and Northern Italy. Overall, the study highlights the feasibility of using SRPs in hydrological applications over the Mediterranean region with benefits in discharge simulations also in well gauged areas.},

abstract = {The Himalayan region of Nepal and northern India experiences hydrological extremes from monsoonal floods during July to September, when most of the annual precipitation falls, to periods of very low flows during the dry season (December to February). While the monsoon floods cause acute disasters such as loss of human life and property, mudslides and infrastructure damage, the lack of water during the dry season has a chronic impact on the lives of local people. The management of water resources in the region is hampered by relatively sparse hydrometerological networks and consequently, many resource assessments are required in catchments where no measurements exist. A hydrological model for estimating dry season flows in ungauged catchments, based on recession curve behaviour, has been developed to address this problem. Observed flows were fitted to a second order storage model to enable average annual recession behaviour to be examined. Regionalised models were developed, using a calibration set of 26 catchments, to predict three recession curve parameters: the storage constant; the initial recession flow and the start date of the recession. Relationships were identified between: the storage constant and catchment area; the initial recession flow and elevation (acting as a surrogate for rainfall); and the start date of the recession and geographic location. An independent set of 13 catchments was used to evaluate the robustness of the models. The regional models predicted the average volume of water in an annual recession period (1st of October to the 1st of February) with an average error of 8{\%}, while mid-January flows were predicted to within ±50{\%} for 79{\%} of the catchments in the data set.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p style="line-height: 20px;"{\textgreater}{\textless}b{\textgreater}Keywords: {\textless}/b{\textgreater}Himalaya, recession curve, water resources, ungauged catchment, regionalisation, low flows},

abstract = {The separation of storm hydrographs using stable isotope tracers dates back to the late 1960s. These studies ushered in a paradigm shift in how hydrologists conceptualized runoff generation as most showed a large preponderance of pre-event water in the storm hydrograph, even at peak flow. This forced a fundamental re-examination of the processes of water delivery to streams during rainfall and snowmelt events. Whilst the simplicity of the two-component hydrograph separation was a powerful tool for showing the importance of stored water effusion, the assumptions implicit in the two-component model have now become limiting for further advancement of the approach. Here we review the use of stable isotopes for hydrograph separation with particular reference to studies completed since the last comprehensive review of the subject in 1994. We review critically the contributions to new field knowledge gained by isotope hydrograph separation applications. We focus specifically on the current issues regarding the limitations of the two-component approach. We examine the role of soil water as a contributor to channel stormflow and the issues raised by differences in the soil water and groundwater signatures at the watershed scale. Finally, we offer ideas on how to overcome the limitations of the two-component approach and present a vision for future directions for isotope based hydrograph separation. These future directions are focused on high frequency analysis of rainfall-runoff structures and dual isotope analysis of catchment end-members including comparison of lysimeter-based soil water sampling of mobile soil water versus cryogenic and vapor-based analysis of tightly bound water. ?? 2013 .},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that improvements in the regional prediction of low-flow characteristics can be obtained through the inclusion of a parameter characterising catchment baseflow recession. Usually, a linear reservoir model is assumed to define recession characteristics used as predictors in regional models. We propose in this study to adopt instead a non-linear model. Predictors derived from the linear model and the non-linear model are used separately in low-flow regional models along with other predictors representing physiographical and meteorological characteristics. These models are applied to selected gaged catchments. Results show that better performances are obtained with the parameter from the non-linear model. One drawback of using recession parameters for regional estimation is that a streamflow record is required at the site of interest. However, recession parameters can be estimated with short streamflow records. In this study, to simulate the performances obtained at partially gaged catchments, the recession parameters are estimated with very short streamflow records at target sites. Results indicate that, with a streamflow record as short as one year, a model with a recession parameter from the non-linear model leads to better performances than a model with only physiographical and meteorological characteristics.},

Stephenson (Guest-Editors), Contemporary Hydrogeology - The George Burke Maxey Memorial Volume. J. Hydrol., 43: 45-65. Groundwater plays a much more active, responsive and significant role in the generation, of storm and snow-melt runoff in streams than the recent literature on the subject suggests. Basin-wide tracer experiments using environmental isotopes (18O, deuterium, tritium) and hydrometric studies carried out in hydrogeologically diverse watersheds, indicate that for all except the most intense rain storms and the most prolific melting days, groundwater dominates the runoff hydrographs in the study basins. The increased groundwater discharge during runoff events is apparently related to a rapid rise in hydraulic head along the perimeter of transient and perennial discharge areas. This groundwater ridging phenomenon probably arises from the almost instantaneous conversion of the near-surface tension-saturated capillary fringe into phreatic water. The ridging precedes, and is apparently independent of the response of the rest of the basin. In addition to its compatibility with several of the field observations commonly associated with contemporary concepts of runoff generation, the groundwater discharge theory explains some of the temporal variations in stream water chemistry which are not adequately accounted for by other theories.},

@article{Ruelland2008a,
abstract = {This paper examines the sensitivity of a hydrological model to several methods of spatial interpolation of rainfall data. The question is investigated in a context of scarcity of data over a large West African catchment (100,000 km2) subject to a drastic trend of rain deficit since the 1970s. Thirteen widely scattered rainfall stations and their daily time series were used to interpolate gridded rainfall surfaces over the 1950-1992 period via various methods: Thiessen polygons, inverse distance weighted (IDW) method, thin smooth plate splines (spline), and ordinary kriging. The accuracy of these interpolated datasets was evaluated using two complementary approaches. First, a point-by-point assessment was conducted, involving comparison of the interpolated values by reference to observed point data. Second, a conceptual rainfall-runoff model (Hydrostrahler) was used in order to assess whether and to what extent the alternative sets of interpolated rainfall impacted on the hydrological simulations. A lumped modelling exercise over a long period (1952-1992) and a semi-distributed exercise over a short period (1971-1976) were performed, using calibrations aimed at optimizing a Nash-Sutcliffe criterion. The results were evaluated for each interpolated forcing dataset using statistical analysis and visual inspection of the simulated and observed hydrographs and the parameters obtained from calibration. Assessment of the interpolation methods by reference to point data indicates that interpolations using the IDW and kriging methods are more efficient than the simple Thiessen technique, and, to a lesser extent, than spline. The use of these data in a daily lumped modelling application shows a different ranking of the various interpolation methods with regard to various hydrological assessments. The model is particularly sensitive to the differences in the rainfall input volume produced by each interpolation method: the IDW dataset yields the highest hydrological efficiency while the spline dataset gets the poorest results. Although the calibration procedure makes it possible to partly compensate for the differences (or errors) between rain input datasets, the semi-distributed hydrological model remains sensitive to volumetric and spatial differences. Then, assessment of these combined differences through the sensitivity of the semi-distributed model provides us with more complete discrimination between the interpolated data inputs. The output results at the basin outlet do not decrease between the lumped and semi-distributed modelling exercises with the IDW and kriging datasets, in contrast to the Thiessen and spline datasets, which tends to indicate the superiority of the former two interpolated inputs. In this hydrological application, the IDW dataset is still shown to provide the most realistic results. Moreover, despite the scarcity of rainfall data, coherent semi-distributed values of the model parameters are obtained by calibration over a large gradient of climate conditions. Finally, it is observed that although the model reproduced the rainfall-runoff relationship before 1970 very well, regardless of which interpolated datasets were used, it was not able to satisfactorily simulate the basin behaviour after the change in rainfall regime. This inability needs further investigation and is the subject of ongoing research. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We utilize a heterogeneous dataset of 280 catchments located in the Eastern US to understand hydrologic similarity in a 6-dimensional signature space across a region with strong environmental gradients. Signatures are defined as hydro- logic response characteristics that provide insight into the hydrologic function of catchments. A Bayesian clustering scheme is used to separate the catchments into 9 homoge- neous classes, which enable us to interpret hydrologic sim- ilarity with respect to similarity in climatic and landscape attributes across this region.

abstract = {Three-component (throughfall, soil water, groundwater) hydrograph separations at peak flow were performed on 10 storms over a 2-year period in a small forested catchment in north-central Maryland using an iterative and an exact solution. Seven pairs of tracers (deuterium and oxygen 18, deuterium and chloride, deuterium and sodium, deuterium and silica, chloride and silica, chloride and sodium, and sodium and silica) were used for three-component hydrograph separation for each storm at peak flow to determine whether or not the assumptions of hydrograph separation routinely can be met, to assess the adequacy of some commonly used tracers, to identify patterns in hydrograph-separation results, and to develop conceptual models for the patterns observed. Results of the three-component separations were not always physically meaningful, suggesting that assumptions of hydrograph separation had been violated. Uncertainties in solutions to equations for hydrograph separations were large, partly as a result of violations of assumptions used in deriving the separation equations and partly as a result of improper identification of chemical compositions of end-members. Results of three-component separations using commonly used tracers were widely variable. Consistent patterns in the amount of subsurface water contributing to peak flow (45–100{\%}) were observed, no matter which separation method or combination of tracers was used. A general conceptual model for the sequence of contributions from the three end-members could be developed for 9 of the 10 storms. Overall results indicated that hydrochemical and hydrometric measurements need to be coupled in order to perform meaningful hydrograph separations.},

abstract = {The availability of good and reliable rainfall data is fundamental for most hydrological analyses and for the design and management of water resources systems. However, in practice, precipitation records often suffer from missing data values mainly due to malfunctioning of raingauge for specific time periods. This is an important issue in practical hydrology because it affects the continuity of rainfall data and ultimately influences the results of hydrologic studies which use rainfall as input. Many methods to estimate missing rainfall data have been proposed in literature and, among these, most are based on spatial interpolation algorithms. In this paper different spatial interpolation algorithms have been evaluated to produce a reasonably good continuous dataset bridging the gaps in the historical series. The algorithms used are deterministic methods such as inverse distance weighting, simple linear regression, multiple regression, geographically weighted regression and artificial neural networks, and geostatistical models such as ordinary kriging and residual ordinary kriging. In some of these methods, the elevation information, provided by a Digital Elevation Model, has been added to improve estimation of missing data. These algorithms have been applied to the mean annual and monthly rainfall data of Sicily (Italy), measured at 247 raingauges. Optimization of different settings of the various interpolation methods has been carried out using a subset of the available rainfall dataset (modeling set) while the remaining subset (validation set) has been used to compare the results obtained by the different algorithms. Validation results indicate that the univariate methods, neglecting the information of elevation, are characterized by the largest errors, which decrease when the elevation is taken into account. The ordinary kriging of residuals from linear regression between precipitation and elevation, which has provided the best performance at annual and monthly scale, has been used to complete the precipitation monthly time series in Sicily. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Identification and removal of surface depressions is a critical step for automated modelling of surface rainfall runoff based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). At present, nearly all GIS and hydrologic software packages employ Jenson and Domingue's method for preparing depressionless DEMs for hydrologic analysis. This conventional method is computationally intensive and time-consuming. With the growing availability of high-resolution DEMs produced by airborne LIDAR and InSAR techniques, GIS-based hydrologic applications often need to handle larger geographic areas at finer resolutions. In the face of high-resolution DEMs, the conventional method becomes inadequate and deficient. In this paper, we present a new method for efficiently identifying and filling surface depressions in DEMs. This method can simultaneously determine flow paths and spatial partition of watersheds with one pass of processing. A novel concept of spill elevation and the least-cost search for optimal flow paths are the two cornerstones of our method. The time complexity of our method is in O(Nlog N). It has been implemented using C+ + programming language and successfully applied to USGS DEMs and LIDAR DEMs of various sizes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the conventional method by a factor of over 30, in terms of running time},

BMA is a statistical procedure that infers consensus predictions by weighing individual predictions based on their probabilistic likelihood measures, with the better performing predictions receiving higher weights than the worse performing ones. Furthermore, BMA provides a more reliable description of the total predictive uncertainty than the original ensemble, leading to a sharper and better calibrated probability density function (PDF) for the probabilistic predictions. In this study, a nine-member ensemble of hydrologic predictions was used to test and evaluate the BMA scheme. This ensemble was generated by calibrating three different hydrologic models using three distinct objective functions. These objective functions were chosen in a way that forces the models to capture certain aspects of the hydrograph well (e.g., peaks, mid-flows and low flows). Two sets of numerical experiments were carried out on three test basins in the US to explore the best way of using the BMA scheme. In the first set, a single set of BMA weights was computed to obtain BMA predictions, while the second set employed multiple sets of weights, with distinct sets corresponding to different flow intervals. In both sets, the streamflow values were transformed using Box-Cox transformation to ensure that the probability distribution of the prediction errors is approximately Gaussian. A split sample approach was used to obtain and validate the BMA predictions. The test results showed that BMA scheme has the advantage of generating more skillful and equally reliable probabilistic predictions than original ensemble. The performance of the expected BMA predictions in terms of daily root mean square error (DRMS) and daily absolute mean error (DABS) is generally superior to that of the best individual predictions. Furthermore, the BMA predictions employing multiple sets of weights are generally better than those using single set of weights. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, multiple aspects of how rainfall-runoff process controls the value of the intercept (??) and the scaling exponent (??) are not fully understood. We use the rainfall-runoff model CUENCAS and apply it to three different river basins in Iowa to investigate how the interplay among rainfall intensity, duration, hillslope overland flow velocity, channel flow velocity, and the drainage network structure affects these parameters. We show that, for a given catchment: (1) rainfall duration and hillslope overland flow velocity play a dominant role in controlling ??, followed by channel flow velocity and rainfall intensity; (2) ?? is systematically controlled by the interplay among rainfall intensity, duration, hillslope overland flow velocity, and channel flow velocity, which highlights that it is the combined effect of these factors that controls the exact values of ?? and ??; and (3) a scale break occurs when runoff generated on hillslopes runs off into the drainage network very rapidly and the scale at which the break happens is determined by the interplay among rainfall duration, hillslope overland flow velocity, and channel flow velocity. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPS) have in recent years been increasingly used for the operational forecasting of floods by hydrometeorological agencies. The most obvious advantages of HEPS are that more of the uncertainty in the modelling system can be assessed; and that ensemble prediction systems generally have better skill than deterministic systems both in the terms of the mean forecast performance and the potential forecasting of extreme events. Research efforts have so far mostly been devoted to the improvement of the technical aspects of the model systems themselves. However, in this paper we argue that there are other areas of HEPS that need urgent attention; such as assessment of the full uncertainty in the forecast chain, multimodel approaches, robust forecast skill assessment and further collaboration and knowledge exchange between operational forecasters and the model development community. In light of limited resources we suggest a simple model to classify the identified priorities in terms of their cost and complexity to decide in which order to tackle them This model is then used to create an action plan of short-, medium- and long-term research priorities with the ultimate goal of an optimal improvement in operational HEPS.},

abstract = {The interaction between streams and groundwater controls key features of the stream hydrograph and chemograph. Since surface runoff is usually less saline than groundwater, flow events are usually accompanied by declines in stream salinity. In this paper, we use numerical modelling to show that, at any particular monitoring location: (i) the increase in stream stage associated with a flow event will precede the decrease in solute concentration (arrival time lag for solutes); and (ii) the decrease in stream stage following the flow peak will usually precede the subsequent return (increase) in solute concentration (return time lag). Both arrival time lag and return time lag increase with increasing wave duration. However, arrival time lag decreases with increasing wave amplitude, whereas return time lag increases. Furthermore, while arrival time lag is most sensitive to parameters that control river velocity (channel roughness and stream slope), return time lag is most sensitive to groundwater parameters (aquifer hydraulic conductivity, recharge rate, and dispersitivity). Additionally, the absolute magnitude of the decrease in river concentration is sensitive to both river and groundwater parameters. Our simulations also show that in-stream mixing is dominated by wave propagation and bank storage processes, and in-stream dispersion has a relatively minor effect on solute concentrations. This has important implications for spreading of contaminants released to streams. Our work also demonstrates that a high contribution of pre-event water (or groundwater) within the flow hydrograph can be caused by the combination of in-stream and bank storage exchange processes, and does not require transport of pre-event water through the catchment.},

abstract = {Spatial interpolation of climatic data is frequently required to provide input for plant growth models. As no single method is optimal for all regions, it is important to compare the results obtained using alternative methods applied to each data set. For estimating 30-year averages (Normals) of monthly temperature and precipitation at speci{\textregistered}c sites in western Canada, we examined four forms of kriging and three simple alternatives. One of the alternatives was a novel technique, termed `gradientplus- inverse distance squared' (GIDS), which combines multiple linear regression and distance-weighting. Based on the mean absolute errors from cross-validation tests, the methods were ranked GIDS {\textgreater} detrended kriging {\textgreater} nearest neighbour {\textgreater}cokriging {\textgreater} inverse distance squared {\textgreater} universal kriging {\textgreater} ordinary kriging for interpolating monthly temperature, and GIDS {\textgreater} co-kriging{\textgreater}inverse distance squared {\textgreater} nearest neighbour {\textgreater} ordinary kriging {\textgreater} detrended kriging {\textgreater} universal kriging for interpolating monthly precipitation. GIDS gave the lowest errors, which averaged 0.58C for monthly temperature and 3.6 mm, or 11{\%}, for monthly precipitation. These errors were comparable with those from optimal methods in other studies. GIDS errors were also more consistent for a wide range of data variability than the other methods. The performance of kriging may have been constrained by the limited number of stations (32) in the study region, but if so, this is an unavoidable limitation in regions with sparse coverage of climate stations. Compared with kriging, GIDS was simple to apply and avoided the subjectivity involved in de{\textregistered}ning variogram models and neighbourhoods. We conclude that GIDS is a simple, robust and accurate interpolation method for use in our region, and that it should be applicable elsewhere, subject to careful comparison with other methods.},

abstract = {Scales of soil moisture variations are important for understanding patterns of climate change, for developing and evaluating land surface models, for designing surface soil moisture observation networks, and for determining the appropriate resolution for satellite-based remote sensing instruments for soil moisture. Here we take advantage of a new archive of in situ soil moisture observations from Illinois and Iowa in the United States, and from Russia, Mongolia, and China, to evaluate the observed temporal and spatial scales of soil moisture variations. We separate the variance into two components, the very small scale, determined by soils, topography, vegetation, and root structure, and the large scale forced by the atmosphere. This larger scale, determined by precipitation and evaporation patterns, is of interest for global climate modeling. We characterize the small scale as white noise for our analysis, keeping in mind that it is an important component of soil moisture variations for other problems. We find that the atmospheric spatial scale for all regions is about 500 km. The atmospheric temporal scale is about 2 months for the top 1-m soil layer. The temporal scale for the top 10-cm layer is slightly less than 2 months. The white noise component of the variance for temporal variations ranges from 50{\%} for the top 10 cm to 20–40{\%} for the top 1 m. For spatial variations the white noise component is the same for all depths but varies with region from 30{\%} for Illinois to around 70{\%} for Mongolia. Nevertheless, the red noise (atmospheric component) can be seen in all regions. These results are for Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes and would not necessarily apply to other latitudes. The results are based on observations taken from grassland or agricultural areas, and may not be similar to those of areas with other vegetation types. In China, a region with substantial latitudinal variation, the temporal scale for the top 1 m varies from 1 month in the south to 2.5 months in the north, demonstrating the control of potential evaporation on the temporal scales. Seasonal analysis of the scales of soil moisture for Illinois shows that during the winter the temporal scales are long, though the spatial scales are short. We suggest that these variations are both attributable to the seasonal cycle of potential evaporation.},

abstract = {The paper presents a data-driven approach to the modelling and forecasting of hydrological systems based on nonlinear time-series analysis. Time varying parameters are estimated using a combined Kalman filter and fixed-interval-smoother, and state-dependent parameter relations are identified leading to nonlinear extensions to common time-series models such as the autoregressive exogenous (ARX) and general transfer function (TF). This nonlinear time-series technique is used as part of a data-based mechanistic modelling methodology where models are objectively identified from the data, but are only accepted as a reasonable representation of the system if they have a valid mechanistic interpretation. To this end it is shown that the TF model can represent a general linear storage model that subsumes many common hydrological flow forecasting models, and that the rainfall-runoff process can be represented using a nonlinear input transformation in combination with a TF model. One advantage of the forecasting models produced is that the Kalman filter can be used for real-time state updating leading to improved forecasts and an estimate of associated forecast uncertainty. Rainfall-runoff and flood routing case studies are included to demonstrate the power of the modelling and forecasting methods. One important conclusion is that optimal system identification techniques are required to objectively identify parallel flow pathways.},

abstract = {This paper discusses using a GIS-based geomorphological routing model to simulate urban stormwater runoff as an alternative to physically based routing models. Hydrological measurements have been carried out (1982-1984) in the urban catchment El Batan (52 km 
                        2), which forms part of the city of Quito (Ecuador). As detailed data on the drainage network were available, a first attempt was made using, on the one hand, complete Barr?? de Saint-Venant equations in the network and, on the other, the linear reservoir model for the sub-catchments. Knowing both the geometry and hydraulics of the network was proved to achieve accurate simulations. However, collecting the network data and building the whole topology (reaches, nodes, sub-catchments) of this large urban catchment is very time-consuming work. Thus, grosser representations of the network to simulate runoff were tested, but it was found that the estimation of the concentration time becomes predominant, and may result in a significant loss of accuracy. Using a GIS-based geomorphological routing model is shown to be an efficient alternative: first, physical velocities in the reaches can be derived from slopes and upstream areas; second, the integration of these velocities in a distributed lag and route model produces flood simulations that are equivalent to the physically based routing model; third, Digital Elevation Models avoid most of the tedious preliminary tasks in building the catchment topology. Further investigation is required in order to evaluate variations in the lag parameter from one catchment to another. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In hydrology, it is the accuracy of the rainfall measurement at spatial and temporal scales that drive catchment response that is important. Random sampling errors are the residual errors that remain in radar rainfall measurements after systematic biases have been removed. This paper quantiﬁes radar rainfall sampling errors at catchment scale by developing and applying a stochastic space–time model. Random errors caused by temporal and spatial sampling, random variations in the vertical proﬁle of reﬂectivity, and variations in the reﬂectivity–rainfall intensity ( Z–R) relationship have been included in the model. The stochastic radar rainfall error model is applied in a numerical experiment to quantify sampling errors in radar rainfall accumulations for periods between 10 min and 1 day across catchment areas of between 1 and 1024 km 2 . Spatial and temporal averaging results in signiﬁcant reductions in sampling errors at catchment scale. The dominant inﬂuence on error in the radar rainfall sampling error model is the height of the radar beam over the catchment.},

A historical perspective of hydrologic modeling is provided, and new developments and challenges in watershed models are discussed. These include data acquisition by remote sensing and space technology, digital terrain and elevation models, chemical tracers, geographic information and data management systems, topographic representation, upscaling of hydrologic conservation equations, spatial variability of hydraulic roughness, infiltration and precipitation, spatial and temporal scaling, model calibration, and linking with water quality models. Model construction, calibration, and data processing have received a great deal of attention, while model validation, error propagation, and analyses of uncertainty, risk and reliability have not been treated as thoroughly. Finally, some remarks are made regarding the future outlook for watershed hydrology modeling.},

abstract = {Distributed watershed models are now widely used in practice to simulate runoff responses at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Counter to this purpose, diagnostic analyses of distributed models currently aggregate performance measures in space and/or time and are thus disconnected from the models' operational and scientific goals. To address this disconnect, this study contributes a novel approach for computing and visualizing time-varying global sensitivity indices for spatially distributed model parameters. The high-resolution model diagnostics employ the method of Morris to identify evolving patterns in dominant model processes at sub-daily timescales over a six-month period. The method is demonstrated on the United States National Weather Service's Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) in the Blue River watershed, Oklahoma, USA. Three hydrologic events are selected from within the six-month period to investigate the patterns in spatiotemporal sensitivities that emerge as a function of forcing patterns as well as wet-to-dry transitions. Surprisingly, events with similar magnitudes and durations exhibit significantly different performance controls in space and time, indicating that the diagnostic inferences drawn from representative events will be heavily biased by the a priori selection of those events. By contrast, this study demonstrates high-resolution time-varying sensitivity analysis, requiring no assumptions regarding representative events and allowing modelers to identify transitions between modeled hydrologic regimes a posteriori. The proposed approach details the dynamics of parameter sensitivity in nearly continuous time, providing critical diagnostic insights into the underlying model processes driving predictions. Furthermore, the approach offers the potential to identify transition points between hydrologic regimes under nonstationarity.},

abstract = {Understanding how watershed characteristics and climate influence the baseflow component of stream discharge is a topic of interest to both the scientific and water management communities. Therefore, the development of baseflow estimation methods is a topic of active research. Previous studies have demonstrated that graphical hydrograph separation (GHS) and conductivity mass balance (CMB) methods can be applied to stream discharge data to estimate daily baseflow. While CMB is generally considered to be a more objective approach than GHS, its application across broad spatial scales is limited by a lack of high frequency specific conductance (SC) data. We propose a new method that uses discrete SC data, which are widely available, to estimate baseflow at a daily time step using the CMB method. The proposed approach involves the development of regression models that relate discrete SC concentrations to stream discharge and time. Regression-derived CMB baseflow estimates were more similar to baseflow estimates obtained using a CMB approach with measured high frequency SC data than were the GHS baseflow estimates at twelve snowmelt dominated streams and rivers. There was a near perfect fit between the regression-derived and measured CMB baseflow estimates at sites where the regression models were able to accurately predict daily SC concentrations. We propose that the regression-derived approach could be applied to estimate baseflow at large numbers of sites, thereby enabling future investigations of watershed and climatic characteristics that influence the baseflow component of stream discharge across large spatial scales.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the analysis of the 1 October 2009 flash flood and debris flow event caused by a very intense rainfall concentrated over the Messina area. The storm caused severe flash floods in many villages around the city of Messina, such as Giampilieri, Scaletta Zanclea, Altolia Superiore and Molino, with 38 casualties and significant damages to property, buildings, roads and bridges estimated close to 550 million Euro. The main focus of this work is to perform a post event analysis, putting together available meteorological and hydrological data in order to get better insight into temporal and spatial variability of the rain storm, the soil moisture conditions and the consequent flash flood in the Giampilieri catchment. The event was investigated using observed data from a raingauge network. Statistical analysis using GEV distribution was performed and rainfall return period (storm severity) was estimated. Further, measured rainfall data and rainfall-runoff modelling were used to estimate soil moisture conditions, to analyse the hydrological behaviour and to reconstruct flood hydrograph. With the help of GIS technology and particularly spatial analysis, the volume of debris which has gone down into the Giampilieri village was also calculated. GIS maps with landslide and material deposit areas were produced and analysed.},

abstract = {Soil moisture memory (SMM) is not only important for atmospheric weather/climate forecasting, but may also be useful in flood and drought prediction. Despite their importance, SMM studies are restricted in certain regions due to the scarcity of soil moisture data. To overcome this limitation, this study explains the variability of SMM in wet and dry basins, and shows an alternative way to predict the basin scale SMM using observed precipitation and potential evapotranspiration information only. This study presents the basin average SMM in the form of a timescale that indicates the duration of significant autocorrelations at 95{\%} confidence intervals. The soil moisture autocorrelations were calculated using observed precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, streamflow and soil moisture data sets simulated using the XinAnJiang (XAJ) model, for 26 river basins across the USA. The XAJ model's capability to simulate seasonal cycles (temporal anomalies) of soil moisture was validated against cycles from the observed data set of the Spoon River basin of Illinois State, USA. Based on the validation experience, the XAJ model was thereafter used to simulate soil moisture data for the analysed basins.Basin scale SMM timescale ranges were computed from 11 to 133days. The SMM timescale is highly influenced by precipitation variability and exhibits strong seasonality. Dry basins tend to show the highest memory during the winter months (December to February) and lowest in late spring (May). In contrast, wet basins have the lowest memory during winter and early spring (December to April) and highest in the late summer and early autumn (July to September). The SMM timescale displayed an exponential relationship with the basin aridity index, with an r2 value of 0.9. This relationship could be a cheap source of basin scale SMM prediction from widely available observed data sets (actual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration), and thus, could afford some knowledge of SMM under no knowledge conditions.},

abstract = {The forecast of debris flow occurrence relies mainly on empirical rainfall intensity-duration thresholds, which are based on rain gauge observations. This work focuses on the effect of rainfall estimation uncertainty on the estimation of debris flow triggering rainfall events and on the identification of rainfall thresholds for debris flow occurrence. Specifically, the influence of rain gauge network density and the interpolation method on the estimation of debris flow triggering rainfall is investigated. These questions are examined using high-resolution, carefully corrected radar data to represent space-time patterns of true precipitation at the debris flow initiation points and in the surrounding area. Radar rainfall fields are sampled by simulated rain gauge networks, stochastically generated with varying rain gauge densities. Based on these networks, rainfall is estimated by using three rainfall interpolation methods: nearest neighbor (NN), inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK). Results show that NN provides the estimates with bias smaller than IDW and OK but larger estimation variance. Overall, decrease in gauge density leads to increased underestimation and increased estimation variance of debris flow triggering rainfall. Rainfall estimation error leads to large underestimation of the intensity-duration thresholds. However, comparison of results shows that no particular benefit in intensity-duration threshold estimation is obtained by using approaches that are more complex than the NN method.},

abstract = {Baseflow separation methods are often impractical, require expensive materials and time-consuming methods, and/or are not designed for individual events in small watersheds. To provide a simple baseflow separation method for small watersheds, we describe a new precipitation-based technique known as the Sliding Average with Rain Record (SARR). The SARR uses rainfall data to justify each separation of the hydrograph. SARR has several advantages such as: it shows better consistency with the precipitation and discharge records, it is easier and more practical to implement, and it includes a method of event identification based on precipitation and quickflow response. SARR was derived from the United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH) method with several key modifications to adapt it for small watersheds ({\textless}50km 2). We tested SARR on watersheds in the Choptank Basin on the Delmarva Peninsula (US Mid-Atlantic region) and compared the results with the UKIH method at the annual scale and the hydrochemical method at the individual event scale. Annually, SARR calculated a baseflow index that was ???10{\%} higher than the UKIH method due to the finer time step of SARR (1 d) compared to UKIH (5 d). At the watershed scale, hydric soils were an important driver of the annual baseflow index likely due to increased groundwater retention in hydric areas. At the event scale, SARR calculated less baseflow than the hydrochemical method, again because of the differences in time step (hourly for hydrochemical) and different definitions of baseflow. Both SARR and hydrochemical baseflow increased with event size, suggesting that baseflow contributions are more important during larger storms. To make SARR easy to implement, we have written a MatLab program to automate the calculations which requires only daily rainfall and daily flow data as inputs. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We use Stage IV hourly NEXRAD precipitation as the meteorological input for ten model configurations with variable sub-basin sizes. Model parameters are automatically optimized to fit the observed data. The strategy is implemented in Clear Creek Watershed (CCW), which is located in the upper Mississippi River basin. Results show that most of the calibrated parameter values are sensitive to the basin partition scheme and that the relative relevance of physical processes, described by the model, change depending on watershed subdivision. In particular, our results show that parameters derived from different model implementations attribute losses in the system to completely different physical phenomena without a notable effect on the model's performance. Our work adds to the body of evidence demonstrating that automatically calibrated parameters in hydrological models can lead to an incorrect prescription of the internal dynamics of runoff production and transport. Furthermore, it demonstrates that model implementation adds a new dimension to the problem of non-uniqueness in hydrological models.},

Al- though the literature on this topic is abundant, the results are contrasting and sometimes contradictory. This paper in- vestigates the impact of spatial rainfall on runoff generation to better understand the conditions where higher-resolution rainfall information improves streamflow simulations. In this study, we used the rainfall reanalysis developed by M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}o- France over the whole country of France at 1km and 1 h resolution over a 10 yr period. A hydrological model was applied in the lumped mode (a single spatial unit) and in the semidistributed mode using three unit sizes of subcatch- ments. The model was evaluated against observed stream- flow data using split-sample tests on a large set of French catchments (181) representing a variety of sizes and climate conditions. The results were analyzed by catchment classes and types of rainfall events based on the spatial variability of precipitation. The evaluation clearly showed different behav- iors. The lumped model performed as well as the semidis- tributed model in western France, where catchments are un- der oceanic climate conditions with quite spatially uniform precipitation fields. By contrast, higher resolution in precip- itation inputs significantly improved the simulated stream- flow dynamics and accuracy in southern France (C{\'{e}}vennes and Mediterranean regions) for catchments in which precipi- tation fields were identified to be highly variable in space. In all regions, natural variability allows for contradictory exam- ples to be found, showing that analyzing a large number of events over varied catchments is warranted.},

abstract = {As a key variable of the land-climate system soil moisture is a main driver of streamflow and evapotranspiration under certain conditions. Soil moisture furthermore exhibits outstanding memory (persistence) characteristics. Many studies also report distinct low frequency variations for streamflow, which are likely related to soil moisture memory. Using data from over 100 near-natural catchments located across Europe, we investigate in this study the connection between soil moisture memory and the respective memory of streamflow and evapotranspiration on different time scales. For this purpose we use a simple water balance model in which dependencies of runoff (normalised by precipitation) and evapotranspiration (normalised by radiation) on soil moisture are fitted using streamflow observations. The model therefore allows us to compute the memory characteristics of soil moisture, streamflow and evapotranspiration on the catchment scale. We find considerable memory in soil moisture and streamflow in many parts of the continent, and evapotranspiration also displays some memory at monthly time scale in some catchments. We show that the memory of streamflow and evapotranspiration jointly depend on soil moisture memory and on the strength of the coupling of streamflow and evapotranspiration to soil moisture. Furthermore, we find that the coupling strengths of streamflow and evapotranspiration to soil moisture depend on the shape of the fitted dependencies and on the variance of the meteorological forcing. To better interpret the magnitude of the respective memories across Europe, we finally provide a new perspective on hydrological memory by relating it to the mean duration required to recover from anomalies exceeding a certain threshold.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic models are useful tools for urban water management. Unfortunately, it is still challenging to obtain accurate results and plausible uncertainty estimates when using these models. In particular, with the currently applied statistical techniques, flow predictions are usually over-confident and biased. In this study, we present a flexible and relatively efficient methodology (i) to obtain more reliable hydrological simulations in terms of coverage of validation data by the uncertainty bands and (ii) to separate prediction uncertainty into its components. Our approach acknowledges that urban drainage predictions are biased. This is mostly due to input errors and structural deficits of the model. We address this issue by describing model bias in a Bayesian framework. The bias becomes an autoregressive term additional to white measurement noise, the only error type accounted for in traditional uncertainty analysis. To allow for bigger discrepancies during wet weather, we make the variance of bias dependent on the input (rainfall) or/and output (runoff) of the system. Specifically, we present a structured approach to select, among five variants, the optimal bias description for a given urban or natural case study. We tested the methodology in a small monitored stormwater system described with a parsimonious model. Our results clearly show that flow simulations are much more reliable when bias is accounted for than when it is neglected. Furthermore, our probabilistic predictions can discriminate between three uncertainty contributions: parametric uncertainty, bias, and measurement errors. In our case study, the best performing bias description is the output-dependent bias using a log-sinh transformation of data and model results. The limitations of the framework presented are some ambiguity due to the subjective choice of priors for bias parameters and its inability to address the causes of model discrepancies. Further research should focus on quantifying and reducing the causes of bias by improving the model structure and propagating input uncertainty.},

abstract = {Quantitative estimation of rainfall fields has been a crucial objective from early studies of the hydrological applications of weather radar. Previous studies have suggested that flow estimations are improved when radar and rain gauge data are combined to estimate input rainfall fields. This paper reports new research carried out in this field. Classical approaches for the selection and fitting of a theoretical correlogram (or semivariogram) model (needed to apply geostatistical estimators) are avoided in this study. Instead, a non-parametric technique based on FFT is used to obtain two-dimensional positive-definite correlograms directly from radar observations, dealing with both the natural anisotropy and the temporal variation of the spatial structure of the rainfall in the estimated fields. Because these correlation maps can be automatically obtained at each time step of a given rainfall event, this technique might easily be used in operational (real-time) applications. This paper describes the development of the non-parametric estimator exploiting the advantages of FFT for the automatic computation of correlograms and provides examples of its application on a case study using six rainfall events. This methodology is applied to three different alternatives to incorporate the radar information (as a secondary variable), and a comparison of performances is provided. In particular, their ability to reproduce in estimated rainfall fields (i) the rain gauge observations (in a cross-validation analysis) and (ii) the spatial patterns of radar fields are analyzed. Results seem to indicate that the methodology of kriging with external drift [KED], in combination with the technique of automatically computing 2-D spatial correlograms, provides merged rainfall fields with good agreement with rain gauges and with the most accurate approach to the spatial tendencies observed in the radar rainfall fields, when compared with other alternatives analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Radar-rainfall products are crucial for input to runoff and flood prediction models, validation of satellite remote sensing algorithms, and for statistical characterization of extreme rainfall frequency. In this context we discuss the issues of radar-rainfall product development, and the theoretical and practical requirements of validating radar-rainfall maps and new radar technologies. We discuss a framework for relfectivity based rainfall estimation, including estimation of uncertainty of radar-rainfall estimates. Validation of radar-rainfall products is a major challenge for broad utilization of these products in hydrologic applications. In the discussion of radar-rainfall prediction we focus on orographically induced extreme rainfall and flooding, discuss the issues of detection, statistical sample size, and scale effects. We conclude the paper with a set of recommendations for research priorities and experimental requirements to address them. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper tackles two main questions by linking observations, determination of hydraulic parameters and measurement of sediment transport with the formulae used in soil erosion models. First, do constant shear stress values in different rills with constant soil parameters result in the same soil detachment values? Secondly, deterministic soil erosion models make the assumption that there is a relationship (often further assumed to be linear) between shear stress and soil detachment; is this suitable for representing real erosion process combinations in natural rills? Following most process based deterministic soil erosion models, derived hydraulic and erosion parameters should be similar. However, the results from the different experiments showed clear differences in sediment concentration, transport rates and other measured as well as calculated values. In contrast to our experimental results, a model simulation would produce erosion parameters with low variations, represented by the relative measurement error and the empirical variation coefficient. This reveals the general problems of using process based deterministic models for erosion in shallow rills. While soil erosion models simulate the processes resulting from the shear forces of flowing water on the soil surface, other processes like side wall failure, headcut retreat and plunge pool dynamics are not taken into account. Our results suggested that these other processes may contribute substantially to rill erosion processes. The results of this study strongly suggested that the model concept of most physical based soil erosion models is inadequate for modeling rill erosion processes. Measured total rill erosion rates were the sum of erosion rates caused by a combination of different soil erosion processes with different spatial and temporal distribution. This combination cannot be described by a single equation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Land surface model experiments are used to quantify, for a number of U.S. river basins, the contributions (isolated and combined) of soil moisture and snowpack initialization to the skill of seasonal streamflow forecasts at multiple leads and for different start dates. Snow initialization has a major impact on skill during the spring melting season. Soil moisture initialization has a smaller but still statistically significant impact during this season, and in other seasons, its contribution to skill dominates. Realistic soil moisture initiali- zation can contribute to skill at long leads (over 6 months) for certain basins and seasons. Skill levels in all seasons are found to be related to the ratio of initial total water storage (soil water plus snow) variance to the forecast period precipitation variance, allowing estimates of the potential for skill in areas outside the veri- fication basins.},

abstract = {The study of baseflow in mountainous areas of basin headwaters, where the characteristics of the often fractured materials are very different to the standard issues concerning porous material applied in conventional hydrogeology, is an essential element in the characterization and quantification of water system resources. Their analysis through recession fragments provides information on the type of response of the sub-surface and subterranean systems and on the average relation between the storage and discharge of aquifers, starting from the joining of these fragments into a single curve, the Master Recession Curve (MRC). This paper presents the generation of the downward MRC over fragments selected after a preliminary analysis of the recession curves, using a hydrological model as the methodology for the identification and the characterization of quick sub-surface flows flowing through fractured materials. The hydrological calculation has identified recession fragments through surface runoff or snowmelt and those periods of intense evapotranspiration. The proposed methodology has been applied to three sub-basins belonging to a high altitude mountain basin in the Mediterranean area, with snow present every year, and their results were compared with those for the upward concatenation of the recession fragments. The results show the existence of two different responses, one quick (at the sub-surface, through the fractured material) and the other slow, with linear behaviour which takes place in periods of 10 and 17 days respectively and which is linked to the dimensions of the sub-basin. In addition, recesses belonging to the dry season have been selected in order to compare and validate the results corresponding to the study of recession fragments. The comparison, using these two methodologies, which differ in the time period selected, has allowed us to validate the results obtained for the slow flow.},

abstract = {Understanding how changes in individual land use types influence the dynamics of streamflow and sediment yield would greatly improve the predictability of the hydrological consequences of land use changes and could thus help stakeholders to make better decisions. Multivariate statistics are commonly used to compare individual land use types to control the dynamics of streamflow or sediment yields. However, one issue with the use of conventional statistical methods to address relationships between land use types and streamflow or sediment yield is multicollinearity. In this study, an integrated approach involving hydrological modelling and partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to quantify the contributions of changes in individual land use types to changes in streamflow and sediment yield. In a case study, hydrological modelling was conducted using land use maps from four time periods (1978, 1987, 1999, and 2007) for the Upper Du watershed (8973km2) in China using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Changes in streamflow and sediment yield across the two simulations conducted using the land use maps from 2007 to 1978 were found to be related to land use changes according to a PLSR, which was used to quantify the effect of this influence at the sub-basin scale. The major land use changes that affected streamflow in the studied catchment areas were related to changes in the farmland, forest and urban areas between 1978 and 2007; the corresponding regression coefficients were 0.232, -0.147 and 1.256, respectively, and the Variable Influence on Projection (VIP) was greater than 1. The dominant first-order factors affecting the changes in sediment yield in our study were: farmland (the VIP and regression coefficient were 1.762 and 14.343, respectively) and forest (the VIP and regression coefficient were 1.517 and -7.746, respectively). The PLSR methodology presented in this paper is beneficial and novel, as it partially eliminates the co-dependency of the variables and facilitates a more unbiased view of the contribution of the changes in individual land use types to changes in streamflow and sediment yield. This practicable and simple approach could be applied to a variety of other watersheds for which time-sequenced digital land use maps are available. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The characterization of the spatial-temporal variability of soil moisture is of paramount importance in many scientific fields and operational applications. However, due to the high variability of soil moisture, its monitoring over large areas and for extended periods through in situ point measurements is not straightforward. Usually, in the scientific literature, soil moisture variability has been investigated over short periods and in large areas or over long periods but in small areas. In this study, an effort to understanding soil moisture variability at catchment scale ({\textgreater}100km 
                        2), which is the size needed for some hydrological applications and for remote sensing validation analysis, is done. Specifically, measurements were carried out in two adjacent areas located in central Italy with extension of 178 and 242km 
                        2 and over a period of 1year (35 sampling days) with almost weekly frequency except for the summer period because of soil hardness. For each area, 46 sites were monitored and, for each site, 3 measurements were performed to obtain reliable soil moisture estimates. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 0-15cm. A statistical and temporal stability analysis is employed to assess the space-time variability of soil moisture at local and catchment scale. Moreover, by comparing the results with those obtained in previous studies conducted in the same study area, a synthesis of soil moisture variability for a range of spatial scales, from few square meters to several square kilometers, is attempted. For the investigated area, the two main findings inferred are: (1) the spatial variability of soil moisture increases with the area up to {\~{}}10km 
                        2 and then remains quite constant with an average coefficient of variation equal to {\~{}}0.20; (2) regardless of the areal extension, the soil moisture exhibits temporal stability features and, hence, few measurements can be used to infer areal mean values with a good accuracy (determination coefficient higher than 0.88). These insights based on in situ soil moisture observations corroborate the opportunity to use point information for the validation of coarse resolution satellite images. Moreover, the feasibility to use coarse resolution data for hydrological applications in small to medium sized catchments is confirmed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Aleotti2004,
abstract = {It is widely recognised that soil slips and debris flows are triggered by short intense storms. Owing its geologic, geomorphologic and climatic settings, the Piedmont Region (NW Italy) is highly prone to the occurrence of this kind of landslides. In the last two centuries, in fact, a total of 105 severe meteoric events which triggered shallow failures occurred and, of these, 18 events took place from 1990 to 2002. A fair number of rainfall thresholds have been proposed in the literature, defined both on empirical or on physical bases. Empirical thresholds are defined collecting rainfall data for landslide meteoric events and for events without landslides, while physical thresholds are based on numerical models that consider the relation between rainfall, pore pressure and slope stability. The main objective of this paper is the identification of the empirical triggering thresholds for the Piedmont Region. Four meteoric events were selected and analysed (November 4-5, 1994; July 7-8, 1996; April 27-30, 2000; October 13-16, 2000) because they supply a wide range of variation for both rainfall parameters (duration, intensity, cumulative rainfalls) and the number of induced landslides. In the intensity-duration plot, the critical limit is described by the equation: I = 19D-0.50 (where I = rainfall intensity expressed in mm/h and D = rainfall duration expressed in hours). Such a limit is traced to envelop 90{\%} of the points on the graph. In the NI-D diagram the triggering thresholds are given by the equations NI = 0.76D-0.33 and NI = 4.62D-0.79 (where NI = normalised intensity with respect to the annual precipitation, MAP, expressed in {\%}, [(mm/h)/PMA] ?? 100). In the article the different meaning of these thresholds is discussed. Finally, the diagram NI-NCR is proposed; the triggering threshold is given by the expression: NI = -0.09ln[NCR] + 0.54 (where NCR is the normalised cumulative critical rainfall, [mm/PMA] ?? 100). The application of the triggering thresholds as a fundamental element in a warning system dedicated to the safeguarding of population in landslide-prone areas is discussed. In detail an operating procedure which is presently being verified and tested in the studied area is described. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An objective common to many watershed studies is to separate storm hydrographs into two components: water that was present in the watershed prior to a storm event (soil moisture and groundwater) and water which fell on the watershed during the storm. To use this approach, a number of assumptions must be made including that the composition of water in the soil moisture and groundwater reservoirs are constant and known. The objective of this paper is to show that in settings where flow and transport are dominated by preferential pathways for flow, steady state mass balance calculations for quantitative hydrograph separation may be in error. We present field data from a site where flow and transport are dominated by preferential pathways (relict fractures in saprolite of sedimentary rocks) which indicate that the ??18O content of the water in the unsaturated and shallow saturated zones is not constant over the course of a storm event. We use a numerical model to further explore the interactions between the fractures and surrounding matrix. Both the field data and modeling results indicate that the ??18O of the previous storm event(s) has a strong influence on water in the fractures. On the time scale of a storm event, only the water in the matrix immediately surrounding the fracture mixes with water in the fracture, while the bulk of the matrix is isolated from fracture flow. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the ??18O in the subsurface and the isolation of the most of the matrix water from flow in fractures make the measurement of a singular ??18O value for subsurface reservoirs problematic and the assumption of a constant value doubtful. Since most near-surface geologic materials have preferential flow paths, we suggest that quantitative hydrograph separation using mass balance techniques is not possible in most situations. Future field and modeling investigations using the approach outlined here could be designed to explore the important temporal and spatial scales of variability in watersheds, and lead to a more quantitative approach to storm hydrograph separation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Despite increasing awareness about the importance of low flows and droughts, spatial and temporal variations in the quantity and quality of baseflow generated in larger catchments are poorly constrained. Here, tracers are used in conjunction with hydrometric analysis to examine the sources of baseflow in the 1849 km2 catchment of the River Dee in Scotland. Geochemical tracers showed that the chemical composition of baseflow evolved downstream, but mainly reflected the dominance of sources in montane tributaries in the upper catchment. These findings were corroborated by hydrometric analysis which showed that the upper 54{\%} of the catchment contributed 71{\%} of baseflow in the lower river. Baseflows in smaller ({\textless}10 km2) headwater sub-catchments exhibited highly variable hydrochemical characteristics which were averaged at larger scales. Analysis of ??18O implies that well-mixed groundwater sources with similar isotopic signatures dominated baseflow generation throughout most of the catchment, probably indicating that groundwater in the lower slopes of montane headwaters provide a major source of baseflow. Periods of baseflow were found to be dynamic; despite the river system being in overall recession, the channel network exhibited contrasting responses to relatively small ({\textless}10 mm) isolated rainfall events in different parts of the catchment. Moreover, diurnal variation in flows in sub-catchments with a high proportion of coverage by peat soils is apparent, which may reflect the daily variation of evapotranspiration as a control on baseflow. Although a relatively stable period in the hydrological year, baseflows in larger catchments result from a complex suite of distributed hydrological processes. Further research is needed to understand how baseflows sustain water supplies and aquatic ecosystems, if managers are to be able to protect these catchment services from environmental change. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We propose an extended study of recent flood-triggering storms and resulting hydrological responses for catchments in the Pyrenean foothills up to the Aude region. For hydrometeorological sciences, it appears relevant to characterize flash floods and the storm that triggered them over various temporal and spatial scales. There are very few studies of extreme storm-caused floods in the literature covering the Mediterranean and highlighting, for example, the quickness and seasonality of this natural phenomenon. The present analysis is based on statistics that clarify the dependence between the spatial and temporal distributions of rainfall at catchment scale, catchment morphology and runoff response. Given the specific space and time scales of rainfall cell development, we show that the combined use of radar and a rain gauge network appears pertinent. Rainfall depth and intensity are found to be lower for catchments in the Pyrenean foothills than for the nearby Corbi{\`{e}}res or Montagne Noire regions. We highlight various hydrological behaviours and show that an increase in initial soil saturation tends to foster quicker catchment flood response times, of around 3 to 10. h. The hydrometeorological data set characterized in this paper constitutes a wealth of information to constrain a physics-based distributed model for regionalization purposes in the case of flash floods. Moreover, the use of diagnostic indices for rainfall distribution over catchment drainage networks highlights a unimodal trend in spatial temporal storm distributions for the entire flood dataset. Finally, it appears that floods in mountainous Pyrenean catchments are generally triggered by rainfall near the catchment outlet, where the topography is lower. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A project established at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand is aimed at developing a prototype of a real-time landslide forecasting system. The objective is to predict temporal changes in landslide probability for shallow, rainfall-triggered landslides, based on quantitative weather forecasts from numerical weather prediction models. Global weather forecasts from the United Kingdom Met Office (MO) Numerical Weather Prediction model (NWP) are coupled with a regional data assimilating NWP model (New Zealand Limited Area Model, NZLAM) to forecast atmospheric variables such as precipitation and temperature up to 48 h ahead for all of New Zealand. The weather forecasts are fed into a hydrologic model to predict development of soil moisture and groundwater levels. The forecasted catchment-scale patterns in soil moisture and soil saturation are then downscaled using topographic indices to predict soil moisture status at the local scale, and an infinite slope stability model is applied to determine the triggering soil water threshold at a local scale. The model uses uncertainty of soil parameters to produce probabilistic forecasts of spatio-temporal landslide occurrence 48 h ahead. The system was evaluated for a damaging landslide event in New Zealand. Comparison with landslide densities estimated from satellite imagery resulted in hit rates of 70-90{\%}.},

abstract = {A Monte Carlo study of a physically based distributed-parameter hydrologic model is described. The catchment model simulates overland flow and streamflow, and it is based on the kinematic wave concept. Soil Conservation Service curves are used to model rainfall excess within the basin. The model was applied to the Ralston Creek watershed, a small (7.5 km2) rural catchment in eastern Iowa. Sensitivity of the model response with respect to rainfall-input spatial and temporal sampling density was investigated. The input data were generated by a space-time stochastic model of rainfall. The generated rainfall fields were sampled by the varied-density synthetic rain gauge networks. The basin response, based on 5-min increment input data from a network of high density with about 1 gauge per 0.1 km2, was assumed to be the “ground truth,” and other results were compared against it. Included in the study was also a simple lumped parameter model based on the unit hydrograph concept. Results were interpreted in terms of hydrograph characteristics such as peak magnitude, time-to-peak, and total runoff volume. The results indicate higher sensitivity of basin response with respect to the temporal resolution than to the spatial resolution of the rainfall data. Also, the frequency analysis of the flood peaks shows severe underestimation by the lumped model. This may have implications for the design of hydraulic structures.},

The comparison between rill and interrill erosion measurements showed that sediment delivery processes occurred in some erosive events and that the rill erosion rate was dominant in many cases.The measurements were used for testing both the empirical relationships between the channel (rill, EGs and gully) length and its eroded volume and among the morphological variables (length, width, depth and volume) describing the channelized process.Finally, the rill and EGs hydraulic geometry was modelled by three well known power equations relating the discharge with the mean flow velocity, with the flow depth and with the width of each channel segment, respectively. The rill measurements also showed that the flow velocity was affected by the rill segment slope while the flow depth and width were controlled by the plot slope. Therefore, three equations, taking into account these slope effects, were proposed to estimate the hydraulic characteristics of the rills monitored at the Sparacia area. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban flash flooding is a serious problem in large, highly populated areas such as the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW). Being able to monitor and predict flash flooding at a high spatiotemporal resolution is critical to providing location-specific early warnings and cost-effective emergency management in such areas. Under the idealized conditions of perfect models and precipitation input, one may expect that spatiotemporal specificity and accuracy of the model output improve as the resolution of the models and precipitation input increases. In reality, however, due to the errors in the precipitation input, and in the structures, parameters and states of the models, there are practical limits to the model resolution. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of streamflow simulation in urban catchments to the spatiotemporal resolution of precipitation input and hydrologic modeling to identify the resolution at which the simulation errors may be at minimum given the quality of the precipitation input and hydrologic models used, and the response time of the catchment. The hydrologic modeling system used in this work is the National Weather Service (NWS) Hydrology Laboratory's Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HLRDHM) applied at spatiotemporal resolutions ranging from 250 m to 2 km and from 1 min to 1 h applied over the Cities of Fort Worth, Arlington and Grand Prairie in DFW. The high-resolution precipitation input is from the DFW Demonstration Network of the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) radars. For comparison, the NWS Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE) product, which is available at a 4-km 1-h resolution, was also used. The streamflow simulation results are evaluated for 5 urban catchments ranging in size from 3.4 to 54.6 km2 and from about 45 min to 3 h in time-to-peak in the Cities of Fort Worth, Arlington and Grand Prairie. The streamflow observations used in evaluation were obtained from water level measurements via rating curves derived from 1-D steady-state non-uniform hydraulic modeling. The results indicate that a spatiotemporal resolution of 500 m and 15 min or higher is a good choice for streamflow prediction using HLRDHM and CASA QPE in the study area, but that, due to the nonlinear accretion of random errors in QPE and imperfect model dynamics, there are trade-offs to consider among resolution, timeliness of prediction and prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {A Regional Water Resources studywas performed at basins within and draining to the Basque Country Region (N of Spain), with a total area of approximately 8500km2. The objective was to obtain daily and monthly long-term discharges in 567 points, most of them ungauged, with basin areas ranging from 0.25 to 1850km2. In order to extrapolate the calibrations at gauged points to the ungauged ones, a distributed and conceptually based model called TETIS was used. In TETIS the runoff production is modelled using five linked tanks at the each cell with different outflow relationships at each tank, which represents the main hydrological processes as snowmelt, evapotranspiration, overland flow, interflow and base flow. The routing along the channels' network couples its geomorphologic characteristics with the kinematic wave approach. The parameter estimation methodology tries to distinguish between the effective parameter used in the model at the cell scale, and the watershed characteristic estimated from the available information, being the best estimation without losing its physical meaning. The relationship between them can be considered as a correction function or, in its simple form, a correction factor. The correction factor can take into account the model input errors, the temporal and spatial scale effects and the watershed characteristics. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the correction factor is the same for each parameter to all cells within the watershed. This approach reduces drastically the number of parameter to be calibrated, because only the common correction factors are calibrated instead of parameter maps (number of parameters times the number of cells). In this way, the calibration can be performed using automatic methodologies. In this work, the Shuffled Com- plex Evolution – University of Arizona, SCE-UA algorithm was used. The available recent year's data was used to calibrate the model in 20 of the most representative flow gauge stations in 18 basins with a Nash-Sutcliffe index higher than 0.6 (10 higher than 0.8). The calibrated correction factors at each basin were similar but not equal. The validation process (in time and space) was performed using the remaining data in all flow gauge stations (62), with 42 basins with a Nash- Sutcliffe index higher than 0.5 (25 higher than 0.7). Deficient calibration and validations were always related with flow gauge stations very close to the karstic springs. These results confirmed that it was feasible and efficient to use the SCE-UA algorithm for the automatic calibration of dis- tributed conceptual models and the calibrated model could be used at ungauged basins. Finally, meteorological information from the past 50 years at a daily scale was used to generate a daily discharges series at 567 selected points.},

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The present study comprises an inter-comparison of different configurations of a statistical post-processor that is used to estimate predictive hydrological uncertainty. It builds on earlier work by Weerts, Winsemius and Verkade (2011; herinafter referred to as WWV2011), who used the Quantile Regression technique to estimate predictive hydrological uncertainty using a deterministic water level forecast as a predictor. The various configurations are designed to address two issues with the WWV2011 implementation: (i) quantile crossing, which causes non-strictly rising cumulative predictive distributions, and (ii) the use of linear quantile models to describe joint distributions that may not be strictly linear. Thus, four configurations were built: (i) ‘classical' Quantile Regression, (ii) a configuration that implements a non-crossing quantile technique, (iii) a configuration where quantile models are built in Normal space after application of the Normal Quantile Transform (similar to the implementation used by WWV2011), and (iv) a configuration that builds quantile model separately on separate domains of the predictor. Using each, four re-forecasting series of water levels at fourteen stations in the Upper Severn river were established. The quality of these four series was inter-compared using a set of graphical and numerical verification metrics. Intercomparison showed that reliability and sharpness vary across configurations, but in none of the configurations do these two forecast quality aspects improve simultaneously. Further analysis shows that skills in terms of Brier Skill Score, mean Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Relative Operating Characteristic Score is very similar across the four configurations.},

abstract = {An automated base now separation technique has been developed and tested. Base flow is considered to be the ground-water contribution to stream now. Estimates of the amount of base flow can be derived from stream flow records. Such estimates are critical in the assessment of low flow characteristics of streams for use in water supply, water management, and pollution assessment. An automated base flow separation technique using a digital filter has been tested against three other automated techniques and manual separation methods. The filter appears to be comparable to other automated techniques in its ability to reproduce the results produced from graphical separation techiques. The filter technique is easy to use and has the added advantage in that it can be adjusted by the user to take into account personnel preferences in separation of stream now into surface flow and base flow. The slope of the base flow recession has been used to estimate the volume of water in storage in the basin above the level of the stream channel, the amount of recharge to the shallow aquifer, and as an input into water budget models. A second automated technique was developed to calculate the slope of the base flow recession curve from stream flow record. This technique is an adaptation of the Master Recession Curve procedure. The results of this method were compared to manual estimates with an efficiency of 74 percent.},

To understand these interactions in relation to climate, landform, geology, and biotic factors, a sound hydrogeoecological framework is needed. All these aspects are synthesized and exemplified in this overview. In addition, the mechanisms of interactions between groundwater and surface water (GW–SW) as they affect recharge–discharge processes are comprehensively outlined, and the ecological significance and the human impacts of such interactions are emphasized. Surface-water and groundwater ecosystems are viewed as linked components of a hydrologic continuum leading to related sustainability issues. This overview concludes with a discussion of research needs and challenges facing this evolving field. The biogeochemical processes within the upper few centimeters of sediments beneath nearly all surface-water bodies (hyporheic zone) have a profound effect on the chemistry of the water interchange, and here is where most of the recent research has been focusing. However, to advance conceptual and other modeling of GW–SW systems, a broader perspective of such interactions across and between surface-water bodies is needed, including multidimensional analyses, interface hydraulic characterization and spatial variability, site-to-region regionalization approaches, as well as cross-disciplinary collaborations.},

In the last decades new instruments, techniques and methods have been developed to capture rainfall and hydrological processes at high resolution. Weather radars have been introduced to estimate high spatial and temporal rainfall variability. At the same time, new models have been proposed to reproduce hydrological response, based on small-scale representation of urban catchment spatial variability. Despite these efforts, interaction between input variability and model resolution remains poorly understood, and further investigations are needed. This paper presents a review of our current understanding of hydrological processes in urban environments as reported in the literature, focusing on their spatial and temporal variability.

However, hydrological applications require an accuracy of the precipitation quantification which cannot be obtained by today's weather radar devices. The quality of the radar-derived precipitation can be significantly improved with the aid of ground measurements. In this paper, a complete processing pipeline for real-time radar precipitation determination using a modified statistical objective analysis method is presented. Thereby, several additional algorithms, such as a dynamical use of Z-R relationships, a bias correction and an advection correction scheme are employed. The performance of the algorithms is tested for several case studies. For an error analysis, an eight months data set of X-band radar scans and rain gauge precipitation measurements is used. We show a reduction in the radar-rain gauge RMS difference of up to 59{\%} for the optimal combination of the different algorithms. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this study, the influence of land use on soil moisture dynamics is investigated for monitoring purposes. To this end, 23 measurement campaigns were carried out during a period of 8months at 5 sites located in central Italy, within a catchment of {\~{}}6km2. The sites are characterized by different land uses: grassland, woodland (holm oak and hornbeam) olive grove and cropland. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 15cm under the soil surface. The optimization of the monitoring scheme was addressed through a statistical and temporal stability analysis. Notwithstanding the significant differences in the land use, the temporal patterns of the field-mean soil moisture of the different sites were very similar while the spatial variability, expressed through the coefficient of variation, was found slightly higher (average value equal to 0.27) than that obtained from previous sampling campaigns on the same area but on sites characterized by a homogeneous soil use. The maximum number of required samples, to estimate the areal mean soil moisture within an accuracy of 2{\%} vol/vol, was found ranging between 7 and 11 at the field scale and equal to 20 at the catchment scale. The temporal stability analysis allowed to identify the grassland site as the most representative of the catchment-mean soil moisture behavior (coefficient of determination, R2=0.96). Therefore, even though the heterogeneity of the land use increases the spatial variability (as expected), soil moisture exhibits a significant temporal stability and its large scale monitoring from few observations is still feasible.},

abstract = {Rainfall estimates of the highest possible accuracy and resolution are required for urban hydrological applications, given the small size and fast response which characterise urban catchments. While radar rainfall estimates have the advantage of well capturing the spatial structure of rainfall fields and its variation in time, the commonly available radar rainfall products (typically at {\~{}}1 km/5-10 min resolution) may still fail to satisfy the accuracy and resolution - in particular temporal resolution - requirements of urban hydrology. A methodology is proposed in this paper, to produce higher temporal resolution, more accurate radar rainfall estimates, suitable for urban hydrological applications. The proposed methodology entails two main steps: (1) Temporal interpolation of radar images from the originally-available temporal resolutions (i.e. 5-10 min) to finer resolutions at which local rain gauge data are commonly available (i.e. 1-2 min). This is done using a novel interpolation technique, based upon the multi-scale variational optical flow technique, and which can well capture the small-scale rainfall structures relevant at urban scales. (2) Local and dynamic gauge-based adjustment of the higher temporal resolution radar rainfall estimates is performed afterwards, by means of the Bayesian data merging method. The proposed methodology is tested using as case study a total of 8 storm events observed in the Cranbrook (UK) and Herent (BE) urban catchments, for which radar rainfall estimates, local rain gauge and depth/flow records, as well as recently calibrated urban drainage models were available. The results suggest that the proposed methodology can provide significantly improved radar rainfall estimates and thereby generate more accurate runoff simulations at urban scales, over and above the benefits derived from the mere application of Bayesian merging at the original temporal resolution at which radar estimates are available. The benefits of the proposed temporal interpolation + merging methodology are particularly evident in storm events with strong and fast-changing (convective-like) rain cells.},

abstract = {The effect of linear flow routing incorporating attenuation and network topology on peak flow scaling exponent is investigated for an instantaneously applied uniform runoff on simulated deterministic and random self-similar channel networks. The flow routing is modelled by a linear mass conservation equation for a discrete set of channel links connected in parallel and series, and having the same topology as the channel network. A quasi-analytical solution for the unit hydrograph is obtained in terms of recursion relations. The analysis of this solution shows that the peak flow has an asymptotically scaling dependence on the drainage area for deterministic Mandelbrot-Vicsek (MV) and Peano networks, as well as for a subclass of random self-similar channel networks. However, the scaling exponent is shown to be different from that predicted by the scaling properties of the maxima of the width functions. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sediment delivery from the Le Sueur River watershed is a major concern in the turbidity-impaired Minnesota River. As part of a broader effort to develop a sediment budget for the Le Sueur River, this study implemented a process-based watershed hydrology and upland erosion model, Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), to simulate hydrology and sediment dynamics in several land-use/land-cover scenarios. The Geo-spatial interface for WEPP (GeoWEPP) was used to characterize upland overland flow elements based on their land use/land cover, soil, and slope profiles. These characteristics were used as inputs for the WEPP model to estimate runoff fluxes, soil loss rates, and sediment delivery ratio (SDR) for three environmental scenarios: current land-use/land-cover with agricultural lands under fall mulch till management (scenario 1), current land-use/land-cover with agricultural lands under no till management (scenario 2), and pre-settlement land-use/land-cover (scenario 3). Over a simulated 30-year period (1979-2008), the runoff depth, soil loss rate and SDR were estimated to be 86. mm, 2.6. T/ha, and 0.84 for scenario 1; 73.8. mm, 0.5.

abstract = {Hydrological models are important tools for flood forecasting and for the assessment of water resources under current and changing climate. However, the accuracy of hydrological models is limited by many factors, the most important of which, is perhaps the errors in the input data. The influence of the precipitation gauge density and network distribution on the modelling results is still a challenging topic in hydrology studies. One of the reasons for the limited study of this important issue is that it needs a catchment with sufficient size, wide diversity of topography and climate, and dense rain gauges with long and good quality data. In this study, a famous and widely used hydrological model, the Xinanjiang Model, was applied in Xiangjiang River basin to examine the influence of rain gauge density and distribution on the performance of the model in simulating the stream flow. The Xiangjiang River basin, one of the most important economic belts in Hunan Province, China and the primary inflow basin of Dongting Lake - China's second largest freshwater lake, has dense rain gauge network with long and high quality data. To perform the study, firstly, the mean areal rainfall estimated by different rain gauge densities using various statistical indices as evaluation criteria was analysed. Secondly, the influence of different rain gauge density and distribution on the model performance was rigorously evaluated. The results show that the error range of the indices in analysing mean areal rainfall and simulated runoff narrowed gradually with increasing number of rain gauges up to some threshold, and beyond which the model performance did not show considerable improvements. The methodology and results of this study will provide useful guidelines and valuable reference for studying rainfall influence in hydrological modelling. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This work presents the results of the implementation of a probabilistic system to model the uncertainty associated to radar rainfall (RR) estimates and the way this uncertainty propagates through the sewer system of an urban area located in the North of England. The spatial and temporal correlations of the RR errors as well as the error covariance matrix were computed to build a RR error model able to generate RR ensembles that reproduce the uncertainty associated with the measured rainfall. The results showed that the RR ensembles provide important information about the uncertainty in the rainfall measurement that can be propagated in the urban sewer system. The results showed that the measured flow peaks and flow volumes are often bounded within the uncertainty area produced by the RR ensembles. In 55{\%} of the simulated events, the uncertainties in RR measurements can explain the uncertainties observed in the simulated flow volumes. However, there are also some events where the RR uncertainty cannot explain the whole uncertainty observed in the simulated flow volumes indicating that there are additional sources of uncertainty that must be considered such as the uncertainty in the urban drainage model structure, the uncertainty in the urban drainage model calibrated parameters, and the uncertainty in the measured sewer flows.},

However, how accurately they estimate baseflow and how to select appropriate values of filter parameters is generally unknown. In this paper, the output of fully integrated surface water/groundwater (SW/GW) models is used to obtain optimal parameters for, and assess the accuracy of, three commonly used RDFs under a range of physical catchment characteristics and hydrological inputs. The results indicate that the Lyne and Hollick (LH) filter performs better than the Boughton and Eckhardt filters, over a larger range of conditions. In addition, the optimal values of the filter parameters vary considerably for all three filters, depending on catchment characteristics and hydrological inputs.

abstract = {In operational hydrological forecasting systems, improvements are directly related to the continuous monitoring of the forecast performance. An efficient evaluation framework must be able to spot issues and limitations and provide feedback to the system developers. In regional systems, the expertise of analysts on duty is a major component of the daily evaluation. On the other hand, large scale systems need to be complemented with semi-automated tools to evaluate the quality of forecasts equitably in every part of their domain.This article presents the current status of the monitoring and evaluation framework of the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS). For each grid point of the European river network, 10-day ensemble streamflow predictions are evaluated against a reference simulation which uses observed meteorological fields as input to a calibrated hydrological model. Performance scores are displayed over different regions, forecast lead times, basin sizes, as well as in time, considering average scores for moving 12-month windows of forecasts. Skilful predictions are found in medium to large rivers over the whole 10-day range. On average, performance drops significantly in river basins with upstream area smaller than 300km2, partly due to underestimation of the runoff in mountain areas. Model limitations and recommendations to improve the evaluation framework are discussed in the final section.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rapid subsurface flow in structured soils facilitates fast vertical and lateral redistribution of event water. Despite their significance and omnipresence the related processes are challenging hydrological exploration, monitoring, modeling and theory. One reason for this is that flow processes at high velocities are difficult to observe in the subsurface. Another reason is that advective flow is channeled in distinct connected structures several orders of magnitude smaller than commonly resolved observation volumes. This is the second part of a companion paper with a focus on $\backslash$textit{\{}in situ{\}} experimental exploration of rapid subsurface flow. Complementary to the temporal dynamics, this study looks into the identification of spatially organized structures. We present a bottom-up approach with point-scale measurements, plot-scale multi-tracer experiments and a hillslope-scale irrigation experiment. Special emphasis is given to the employed 2D and 3D time-lapse ground penetrating radar monitoring under field conditions on forested, young soils on periglacial slope deposits. The study highlights the difficulty to draw conclusions beyond overall heterogeneity from point observations in a basically unknown and structured domain. We also spotlight the challenge to identify relevant structures based on a single quasi-static exploration. A coherent combination of different hydrological and geophysical methods to monitor the system under driven conditions was key to reduce ambiguity in the identification of hydrologically relevant structures and the overall process understanding.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of a rainfall-triggered landslide module within a physically based spatially distributed ecohydrologic model. The model, Triangulated Irregular Networks Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator and VEGetation Generator for Interactive Evolution (tRIBS-VEGGIE), is capable of a sophisticated description of many hydrological processes; in particular, the soil moisture dynamics is resolved at a temporal and spatial resolution required to examine the triggering mechanisms of rainfall-induced landslides. The validity of the tRIBS-VEGGIE model to a tropical environment is shown with an evaluation of its performance against direct observations made within the Luquillo Forest (the study area). The newly developed landslide module builds upon the previous version of the tRIBS landslide component. This new module utilizes a numerical solution to the Richards equation to better represent the time evolution of soil moisture transport through the soil column. Moreover, the new landslide module utilizes an extended formulation of the Factor of Safety (FS) to correctly quantify the role of matric suction in slope stability and to account for unsaturated conditions in the evaluation of FS. The new modeling framework couples the capabilities of the detailed hydrologic model to describe soil moisture dynamics with the Infinite Slope model creating a powerful tool for the assessment of landslide risk.},

These models were tested in Pohang and Gyeongju Cities (South Korea) by using the geographic information system GIS platform. In the first step, a landslide inventory map consisting of 296 landslide locations were prepared from various data sources. Then, a total of 15 landslide causative factors (slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, surface roughness, altitude, distance from drainages, stream power index, topographic wetness index, wood age, wood diameter, wood type, forest density, soil thickness, soil texture, and soil drainage) were extracted from the database and then converted into a raster. Final susceptibility maps exhibit close results from the two models. Models 1 and 3 predicted 82.3{\%} and 80{\%} of testing data during the analysis, respectively. Thus, Models 1 and 3 show better performance than LR. These resultant maps can be used to extend the capability of bivariate statistical based model, by finding the relationship between each single conditioning factor and landslide locations, moreover, the proposed ensemble model can be used to show the inter-relationships importance between each conditioning factors, without the need to refer to the multivariate statistic. The research outcome may provide powerful tools for natural hazard assessment and land use planning. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The overall aim of this research was to investigate the spatial patterns of the soil erosion risk. We focused on accelerated soil erosion processes in an Italian central Apennine intermountain watershed using modeling techniques implemented in a GIS environment. Our thorough literature review revealed a gap in research on soil erosion processes in such forested, intermountain watersheds. To gain a better understanding of the soil erosion processes in such landscapes, we proposed an integrated modeling approach applying a RUSLE model and a Turbidity Unit Index. The model outcomes were validated through measurements of lake sediment deposition. Our findings indicate a potential high soil erosion risk. With 1.33Mt-1yr-1 of annual sediment yield, corresponding to an area-specific sediment yield of 32.35tha-1yr-1, the Turano drainage basin belongs to the Italian basins with the highest sediment discharge. The outcomes of the RUSLE model showed that, despite the diverse forms of forests that cover about 62{\%} of the drainage basin area, sizable plots of the investigated area are prone to soil erosion. The validation of the model outcomes revealed that the TU Index model performed significantly better than the RUSLE model with regard to sediment yield prediction. Accordingly, we found that even though rill and interrill processes reach very alarming values (RUSLE), they are not the dominant sediment source within the Turano watershed. Other geomorphological processes contributing to the watershed sediment yield - for instance, megarill, gully, bank and channel erosion and re-entrainment of landslide sediments - were very active in the study area. If both models are used in a combined approach, the amount of river load (TU Index) as well as the relative spatial distribution of rill and interrill erosion processes (RUSLE) can be described with sufficient precision. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Although catchment behaviour during recession periods is better identifiable than in other periods, the representation of hydrograph recession is often weak in hydrological simulations. Among, the various aspects that influence model performance during low flows, in this paper we concentrate on those more inherently related to the modelling, such as the development of a suitable model conceptualization, and the choice of an appropriate calibration strategy. In this context we develop a methodology where the calibration procedure is combined with an iterative process of model improvement, to obtain an optimal model configuration that performs well both during low flows and high flows. The methodology starts by calculating a synthetic master recession curve that represents the long-term recession of a given catchment. Subsequently, using a simple reservoir model, we determine the storage-discharge relation that simulates the slow hydrograph component. This relation is determined without making any a-priori assumption on its form and is inferred from discharge data available through an iterative process. Next, high flow related parameters are recalibrated separately, to avoid that the simulation of low discharges is neglected in favour of a higher performance in simulating peak discharges. This methodology is applied on several catchments in Luxembourg, and as a result we determined that in all catchments except one (where human interference is high) within the chosen model structure a linear reservoir describes best the observed groundwater behaviour. This result is used to trigger a discussion as to the general suitability of the of a linear groundwater reservoir in hydrological modelling.},

abstract = {Climate change and modification of the urban environment increase the frequency and the negative effects of flooding, increasing the interest of researchers and practitioners in this topic. Usually, flood frequency analysis in urban areas is indirectly carried out by adopting advanced hydraulic models to simulate long historical rainfall series or design storms. However, their results are affected by a level of uncertainty which has been extensively investigated in recent years. A major source of uncertainty inherent to hydraulic model results is linked to the imperfect knowledge of the rainfall input data both in time and space. Several studies show that hydrological modelling in urban areas requires rainfall data with fine resolution in time and space. The present paper analyses the effect of rainfall knowledge on urban flood modelling results. A mathematical model of urban flooding propagation was applied to a real case study and the maximum efficiency conditions for the model and the uncertainty affecting the results were evaluated by means of generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) analysis. The added value provided by the adoption of finer temporal and spatial resolution of the rainfall was assessed.},

abstract = {Artifact depressions in digital elevation models (DEMs) interrupt flow paths and alter drainage directions. Techniques for removing depressions should enforce continuous flow paths in a way that requires the leastmodification of the DEM. Impacts on the spatial and statistical distributions of elevation and its derivatives were assessed for four methods of removing depressions: (1) filling; (2) breaching; (3) a combination of filling and breaching, with breaching constrained to a maximum of two grid cells; (4) a combination of filling and breaching based on an impact reduction approach (IRA). The IRA removes each depression using either filling or breaching, depending on which method has the least impact, in terms of the number of modified cells and the mean absolute difference in the DEM. Analysis of a LiDAR DEM of a landscape on the Canadian Shield showed significant differences in the impacts among the four depression removal methods. Depression filling, a removal method that is widely implemented in geographical information system software, was found to impact terrain attributes most severely. Constrained breaching, which relies heavily on filling for larger depressions, also performed poorly. Both depression breaching and the IRA impacted spatial and statistical distributions of terrain attributes less than depression filling and constrained breaching. The most sensitive landscapes to depression removal were those that contained large (i.e. {\textgreater}10{\%}) flat areas, because of the occurrence of relatively large depressions in these areas.

abstract = {Baseflow is often considered to be the groundwater discharge component of streamflow. It is commonly estimated using conceptual models, recursive filters or a combination of the two. However, it is difficult to validate these methods due to the current challenges of measuring baseflow in the field. In this study, simulation of a synthetic catchment's response to rainfall is carried out using a fully integrated surface water-groundwater flow model. A series of rainfall events with differing recovery periods and varied antecedent moisture conditions is considered to span a range of different streamflow generation dynamics. Baseflow is estimated for the outlet hydrograph of the synthetic catchment using a selection of commonly used automated baseflow separation methods. These estimates are compared to the baseflow signal obtained from the numerical model, which serves as the control experiment. Results from these comparisons show that depending on the method used, automated baseflow separation underestimates the simulated baseflow by as much as 28{\%}, or overestimates it by up to 74{\%}, during rainfall events. No separation method is found to be clearly superior to the others, as the performance of the various methods varies with different soil types, antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall events. The differences between the various approaches clearly demonstrate that the baseflow separation methods investigated are not universally applicable. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We evaluated the sensitivity of electromagnetic induction (EMI) method to variation in soil water in an irrigated cotton field by measuring apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) with a Geonics EM38. ECa was measured at a fixed position in each plot (within the furrow adjacent to stands of cotton planted on ridges) at ground level as well as at 0.1 and 0.4m height above the ground. Measurements were made in both vertical and horizontal modes (VM and HM) of EM38 to allow soil water sensing within 1.5 and 0.75m depths at each location. Surrogate values of soil water were obtained with a locally calibrated neutron probe adjacent to EM38 measurements.All measurements were carried out within three replicate plots of four irrigation treatments at various times during cotton growth. As EC is sensitive to variation in temperature, soil and air temperature was also measured at the time of EM38 measurements. Temporal patterns of variation in ECa and soil water were broadly similar for shallow and deep soil layers. Values of ECa over the season increased nonlinearly with increased values of accumulated soil water within specific depths with high degree of confidence (P???0.001) and high coefficient of determination (R2) for fitted models. Although both soil and air temperature varied over the season (21.2-39.1??C for soil and 26.1-33.2??C for air), dependency of ECa on temperature was weak. The relationship between ECa and soil water was greatly affected by surface configuration in crop fields (i.e. whether the crop was planted on a flat bed or a raised bed) and season. Thus, there is a need to calibrate the EMI equipment to suit local condition in order to measure soil water distribution at field scale.},

abstract = {Rainfall stations with a certain number and spatial distribution supply sampling records of rainfall processes in a river basin. Uncertainty may be introduced when the station records are spatially interpolated for the purpose of hydrological 10 simulations. This study adopts a bootstrap method to quantitatively estimate the uncertainty of areal rainfall estimates and its effects on hydrological simulations. The observed rainfall records are first analysed using clustering and correlation methods, and possible average basin rainfall amounts are calculated with a bootstrap method using various combinations of rainfall station subsets. Then, the uncertainty of simulated runoff, which is propagated through a hydrological model from the spatial uncertainty of rainfall estimates, is analysed with the bootstrapped rainfall inputs. By comparing the uncertainties of rainfall 15 and runoff, the responses of the hydrological simulation to the spatial uncertainty of rainfall are discussed. Analyses are performed for three rainfall events in the upstream of the Qingjian River basin, a sub-basin of the Yellow River. Using the Digital Yellow River Integrated Model, the results show that the uncertainty of rainfall estimates derived from rainfall station network has a direct influence on simulated runoff processes. This quantified relationship between rainfall input and simulation performance can provide useful information on managing rainfall station density in river basins. The proposed 20 method could be a guide to quantify an approximate range of simulated error caused by the spatial uncertainty of rainfall input.},

abstract = {The hydrological response of a catchment to rainfall on different timescales is result of a complex system involving a range of physical processes which may operate simultaneously and have different spatial and temporal influences. This paper presents the analysis of streamflow response of a small humid-temperate catchment (Aixola, 4.8km2) in the Basque Country on different timescales and discusses the role of the controlling factors. Firstly, daily time series analysis was used to establish a hypothesis on the general functioning of the catchment through the relationship between precipitation and discharge on an annual and multiannual scale (2003–2008). Second, rainfall-runoff relationships and relationships among several hydrological variables, including catchment antecedent conditions, were explored at the event scale (222 events) to check and improve the hypothesis. Finally, the evolution of electrical conductivity (EC) during some of the monitored storm events (28 events) was examined to identify the time origin of waters. Quick response of the catchment to almost all the rainfall events as well as a considerable regulation capacity was deduced from the correlation and spectral analyses. These results agree with runoff event scale data analysis; however, the event analysis revealed the non-linearity of the system, as antecedent conditions play a significant role in this catchment. Further, analysis at the event scale made possible to clarify factors controlling (precipitation, precipitation intensity and initial discharge) the different aspects of the runoff response (runoff coefficient and discharge increase) for this catchment. Finally, the evolution of EC of the waters enabled the time origin (event or pre-event waters) of the quickflow to be established; specifically, the conductivity showed that pre-event waters usually represent a high percentage of the total discharge during runoff peaks. The importance of soil waters in the catchment is being studied more deeply},

abstract = {A detailed uncertainty analysis of three-component mixing models based on the Haute-Mentue watershed (Switzerland) is presented. Two types of uncertainty are distinguished: the 'model uncertainty', which is affected by model assumptions, and the 'statistical uncertainty', which is due to temporal and spatial variability of chemical tracer concentrations of components. The statistical uncertainty is studied using a Monte Carlo procedure. The model uncertainty is investigated by the comparison of four different mixing models all based on the same tracers but considering for each component alternative hypotheses about their concentration and their spatio-temporal variability. This analysis indicates that despite the uncertainty, the flow sources, which generate the stream flow are clearly identified at the catchments scale by the application of the mixing model. However, the precision and the coherence of hydrograph separations can be improved by taking into account any available information about the temporal and spatial variability of component chemical concentrations. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we present a well-dated, pollen-based, {\~{}}20-yr-resolution quantitative precipitation reconstruction (derived using a transfer function) from an alpine lake in North China, which provides for the first time a direct record of EASM evolution since 14.7 ka (ka = thousands of years before present, where the "present" is defined as the year AD 1950). Our record reveals a gradually intensifying monsoon from 14.7-7.0 ka, a maximum monsoon (30{\%} higher precipitation than present) from {\~{}}7.8-5.3 ka, and a rapid decline since {\~{}}3.3 ka. These insolation-driven EASM trends were punctuated by two millennial-scale weakening events which occurred synchronously to the cold Younger Dryas and at {\~{}}9.5-8.5 ka, and by two centennial-scale intervals of enhanced (weakened) monsoon during the Medieval Warm Period (Little Ice Age). Our precipitation reconstruction, consistent with temperature changes but quite different from the prevailing view of EASM evolution, points to strong internal feedback processes driving the EASM, and may aid our understanding of future monsoon behaviour under ongoing anthropogenic climate change.},

abstract = {With the increase of urbanization, conditions of the underlying surface and climate have been changed by human activities. This results in more frequent flooding and inundation problems in urban areas. Storm-inundation models based on hydrology and hydrodynamics require a large amount of input data (detailed terrain, sewer system and land use data). Simulation models are complex and difficult to build and run. To determine inundation conditions quickly with only a few commonly available input data, an urban storm-inundation simulation method (USISM) based on geographic information systems (GIS) is proposed in this paper. The method is a kind of simplified distributed hydrologic model based on DEM, in this method, depressions in the terrain are regarded as the basic inundated area. The amount of water that can be stored in a depression indicates the final inundation distribution. The runoff catchment area and maximum storage volume of a depression, and the flow direction between these depressions are all considered in the final inundation simulation. GIS technology is used to find the depressions in an area, divide the subcatchment for each depression, and obtain the flow order of the depressions based on a digital elevation model (DEM). The SCS method is used to calculate storm runoff, and a water balance equation is used to calculate water storage in each depression. Nangang District in Harbin City, China, is selected as the study area to verify the USISM. The result reveals that the USISM could find inundation locations in the urban area and quickly calculate inundation depth and area. The USISM is valuable for simulating storms of short duration in an urban area with a few commonly available input data.},

abstract = {The contribution of rainfall forcing errors relative to model (structural and parameter) uncertainty in the prediction of soil moisture is investigated by integrating the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM), forced with hydro-meteorological data, in the Oklahoma region. Rainfall-forcing uncertainty is introduced using a stochastic error model that generates ensemble rainfall fields from satellite rainfall products. The ensemble satellite rain fields are propagated through CLSM to produce soil moisture ensembles. Errors in CLSM are modeled with two different approaches: either by perturbing model parameters (representing model parameter uncertainty) or by adding randomly generated noise (representing model structure and parameter uncertainty) to the model prognostic variables. Our findings highlight that the method currently used in the NASA GEOS-5 Land Data Assimilation System to perturb CLSM variables poorly describes the uncertainty in the predicted soil moisture, even when combined with rainfall model perturbations. On the other hand, by adding model parameter perturbations to rainfall forcing perturbations, a better characterization of uncertainty in soil moisture simulations is observed. Specifically, an analysis of the rank histograms shows that the most consistent ensemble of soil moisture is obtained by combining rainfall and model parameter perturbations. When rainfall forcing and model prognostic perturbations are added, the rank histogram shows a U-shape at the domain average scale, which corresponds to a lack of variability in the forecast ensemble. The more accurate estimation of the soil moisture prediction uncertainty obtained by combining rainfall and parameter perturbations is encouraging for the application of this approach in ensemble data assimilation systems.},

abstract = {Two recent studies have suggested that neural net- work modelling offers no worthwhile improvements in com- parison to the application of weighted linear transfer func- tions for capturing the non-linear nature of hydrological re- lationships. The potential of an artificial neural network to perform simple non-linear hydrological transformations un- der controlled conditions is examined in this paper. Eight neural network models were developed: four full or partial emulations of a recognised non-linear hydrological rainfall- runoff model; four solutions developed on an identical set of inputs and a calculated runoff coefficient output. The use of different input combinations enabled the competencies of solutions developed on a reduced number of parameters to be assessed. The selected hydrological model had a limited number of inputs and contained no temporal component. The modelling process was based on a set of random inputs that had a uniform distribution and spanned a modest range of possibilities. The initial cloning operations permitted a direct comparison to be performed with the equation-based rela- tionship. It also provided more general information about the power of a neural network to replicate mathematical equa- tions and model modest non-linear relationships. The sec- ond group of experiments explored a different relationship that is of hydrological interest; the target surface contained a stronger set of non-linear properties and was more challeng- ing. Linear modelling comparisons were performed against traditional least squares multiple linear regression solutions developed on identical datasets. The reported results demon- strate that neural networks are capable of modelling non- linear hydrological processes and are therefore appropriate tools for hydrological modelling},

abstract = {Weather radar systems provide detailed information on spatial rainfall patterns known to play a significant role in runoff generation processes. In the current study, we present an innovative approach to exploit spatial rainfall information of air mass thunderstorms and link it with a watershed hydrological model. Observed radar data are decomposed into sets of rain cells conceptualized as circular Gaussian elements and the associated rain cell parameters, namely, location, maximal intensity and decay factor, are input into a hydrological model. Rain cells were retrieved from radar data for several thunderstorms over southern Arizona. Spatial characteristics of the resulting rain fields were evaluated using data from a dense rain gauge network. For an extreme case study in a semi-arid watershed, rain cells were derived and fed as input into a hydrological model to compute runoff response. A major factor in this event was found to be a single intense rain cell (out of the five cells decomposed from the storm). The path of this cell near watershed tributaries and toward the outlet enhanced generation of high flow. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis to cell characteristics indicated that peak discharge could be a factor of two higher if the cell was initiated just a few kilometers aside. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) is a comprehensive, semi-distributed river basin model that requires a large number of input parameters, which complicates model parameterization and calibration. Several calibration tech- niques have been developed for SWAT, including manual calibration procedures and automated procedures using the shuf- fled complex evolution method and other common methods. In addition, SWAT-CUP was recently developed and provides a decision-making framework that incorporates a semi-automated approach (SUFI2) using both manual and automated calibration and incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. In SWAT-CUP, users can manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between autocalibration runs. Parameter sensitivity analysis helps focus the calibration and uncer- tainty analysis and is used to provide statistics for goodness-of-fit. The user interaction or manual component of the SWAT-CUP calibration forces the user to obtain a better understanding of the overall hydrologic processes (e.g., baseflow ratios, ET, sediment sources and sinks, crop yields, and nutrient balances) and of parameter sensitivity. It is important for future calibration developments to spatially account for hydrologic processes; improve model run time efficiency; include the impact of uncertainty in the conceptual model, model parameters, and measured variables used in calibration; and as- sist users in checking for model errors. When calibrating a physically based model like SWAT, it is important to remember that all model input parameters must be kept within a realistic uncertainty range and that no automatic procedure can substitute for actual physical knowledge of the watershed.},

abstract = {Base flow is the ground water contribution to stream flow. Many activities, such as water resource management, calibrating hydrological and climate models, and studies of basin hydrology, require good estimates of base flow. The base flow component of stream flow is usually determined by separating a stream hydrograph into two components, base flow and runoff. Analytical methods, mathematical functions or algorithms used to calculate base flow directly from discharge, are the most widely used base flow separation methods and are often used without calibration to basin or gage-specific parameters other than basin area. In this study, six analytical methods are compared to a mass balance method, the conductivity mass-balance (CMB) method. The base flow index (BFI) values for 35 stream gages are obtained from each of the seven methods with each gage having at least two consecutive years of specific conductance data and 30 years of continuous discharge data. BFI is cumulative base flow divided by cumulative total discharge over the period of record of analysis. The BFI value is dimensionless, and always varies from 0 to 1. Areas of basins used in this study range from 27 km2 to 68,117 km2.BFI was first determined for the uncalibrated analytical methods. The parameters of each analytical method were then calibrated to produce BFI values as close to the CMB derived BFI values as possible. One of the methods, the power function (aQb + cQ) method, is inherently calibrated and was not recalibrated. The uncalibrated analytical methods have an average correlation coefficient of 0.43 when compared to CMB-derived values, and an average correlation coefficient of 0.93 when calibrated with the CMB method. Once calibrated, the analytical methods can closely reproduce the base flow values of a mass balance method. Therefore, it is recommended that analytical methods be calibrated against tracer or mass balance methods.},

abstract = {Flood frequency analyses are often based on recorded series at gauging stations. However, the length of the available data sets is usually too short to provide reliable estimates of extreme design floods. Hence, hydrologists have tried to make use of alternative sources of information to enrich the datasets used for the statistical inferences. Two main approaches were therefore proposed. The first consists in extending the information in time, making use of historical and paleoflood data. The second, spatial extension, consists in merging statistically homogeneous data to build large regional data samples. Recently, a combination of the two techniques aiming at including estimated extreme discharges at ungauged sites of a region in the regional flood frequency analyses has been proposed. This paper presents a consolidation of this approach and its comparison with the standard regional flood frequency approach proposed by Hosking {\&} Wallis. A modification of the likelihood function is introduced to enable the simultaneous calibration of a regional index flood relation and of the parameters of the regional growth curve. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated based on a large number of Monte Carlo simulated data sets. This work confirms that extreme peak discharges estimated at ungauged sites may be of great value for the evaluation of large return period (typically over 100 years) flood quantiles. They should therefore not be neglected despite the uncertainties associated to these estimates. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In northern Morocco are located most of the dams and reservoirs of the country, while this region is affected by severe rainfall events causing floods. To improve the management of the water regulation structures, there is a need to develop rainfall-runoff models to both maximize the storage capacity and reduce the risks caused by floods. In this study, a model is developed to reproduce the flood events for a 655 km2 catchment located upstream of the 6th largest dam in Morocco. Constrained by data availability, a standard event-based model combining a SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service Curve Number) loss model and a Clark unit hydrograph was developed for hourly discharge simulation using 16 flood events that occurred between 1984 and 2008. The model was found satisfactory to reproduce the runoff and the temporal evolution of floods, even with limited rainfall data. Several antecedent wetness conditions estimators for the catchment were compared with the initial condition of the model. Theses estimators include an antecedent discharge index, an antecedent precipitation index and a continuous daily soil moisture accounting model (SMA), based on precipitation and evapotranspiration. The SMA model performed the best to estimate the initial conditions of the event-based hydrological model (R2 Combining double low line 0.9). Its daily output has been compared with ASCAT and AMSR-E remote sensing data products, which were both able to reproduce with accuracy the daily simulated soil moisture dynamics at the catchment scale. This same approach could be implemented in other catchments of this region for operational purposes. The Results of this study suggest that remote sensing data are potentially useful to estimate the soil moisture conditions in the case of ungauged catchments in Northern Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {This study examines the role of rainfall variability on the spatial scaling structure of peak flows using the Whitewater River basin in Kansas as an illustration. Specifically, we investigate the effect of rainfall on the scatter, the scale break and the power law (peak flows vs. upstream areas) regression exponent. We illustrate why considering individual hydrographs at the outlet of a basin can lead to misleading interpretations of the effects of rainfall variability. We begin with the simple scenario of a basin receiving spatially uniform rainfall of varying intensities and durations and subsequently investigate the role of storm advection velocity, storm variability characterized by variance, spatial correlation and intermittency. Finally, we use a realistic space-time rainfall field obtained from a popular rainfall model that combines the aforementioned features. For each of these scenarios, we employ a recent formulation of flow velocity for a network of channels, assume idealized conditions of runoff generation and flow dynamics and calculate peak flow scaling exponents, which are then compared to the scaling exponent of the width function maxima. Our results show that the peak flow scaling exponent is always larger than the width function scaling exponent. The simulation scenarios are used to identify the smaller scale basins, whose response is dominated by the rainfall variability and the larger scale basins, which are driven by rainfall volume, river network aggregation and flow dynamics. The rainfall variability has a greater impact on peak flows at smaller scales. The effect of rainfall variability is reduced for larger scale basins as the river network aggregates and smoothes out the storm variability. The results obtained from simple scenarios are used to make rigorous interpretations of the peak flow scaling structure that is obtained from rainfall generated with the space-time rainfall model and realistic rainfall fields derived from NEXRAD radar data. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Shallow saturated subsurface flow is a dominant runoff mechanism on hillslopes of headwater catchments under humid temperate climate. Its timing and magnitude is significantly affected by the presence of preferential pathways. Reliable prediction of runoff from hillslope soils under such conditions remains a challenge.In this study, a quantitative relationship between rainfall, stormflow, and leakage to bedrock for hillslopes, where lateral preferential runoff represents a dominant part of the overall response, was sought. Combined effects of temporal rainfall distribution and initial hillslope saturation (antecedent moisture conditions) on stormflow, leakage to bedrock, and overall water balance were evaluated by conducting simulations with synthetic rainfall episodes.A two-dimensional dual-continuum model was used to analyze hydrological processes at an experimental hillslope site located in a small forested headwater catchment.Long-term seasonal simulations with natural rainfall indicated that leakage to bedrock occurred mostly as saturated flow during major runoff events. The amount of rainfall needed to initiate stormflow appeared as a dynamic hillslope property, depending on temporal rainfall distribution, initial hillslope storage, and the spatial distribution of soil water within the hillslope. No single valued rainfall threshold responsible for triggering stormflow was found. Rainfall-stormflow as well as rainfall-leakage relationships were found highly nonlinear for low initial hillslope saturations. Temporal rainfall distribution affected the amount of rainfall necessary to initiate stormflow more than it did the amounts of stormflow or leakage to bedrock. In spite of a simple hillslope geometry with constant slope and parallel soil-atmosphere and soil-bedrock interfaces considered in the analysis, the applied model predicted a hysteretic behavior of storage-discharge relationship.The results showed a mutual interplay of components of hillslope water balance exposing a nonlinear character of the hillslope response. The study provided a quantitatively coherent insight in the hydraulic functioning of hillslopes where preferential flow constitutes a dominant part of stormflow.},

abstract = {Simple hydraulic models for outflow of groundwater into a stream suggest that the form of the storage–discharge relationship for groundwater changes from linear, for a confined aquifer, to quadratic, for an unconfined flow. Tests of the form of stream flow recessions in 11 streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments the storage–discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage–discharge relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another, attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An extension of the linear model to ‘leaky' catchments, where the recession reaches zero flow, has been tested on two data sets. The second part of the paper deals with algorithms for baseflow during surface runoff events—the problem of hydrograph separation. Algorithms with one, two and three parameters have been compared, using data for the same 11 streams, and the results show significant differences in the baseflow index (BFI) predicted for some catchments. The two-parameter algorithm, which is fitted subjectively, is more consistent in providing plausible results than either the one- or three-parameter algorithms, both of which can be fitted objectively.},

abstract = {The availability of in situ measurements of precipitation in remote locations is limited. As a result, the use of satellite measurements of precipitation is attractive for water resources management. Combined precipitation products that rely partially or entirely on satellite measurements are becoming increasingly available. However, these products have several weaknesses, for example their failure to capture certain types of precipitation, limited accuracy and limited spatial and temporal resolution. This paper evaluates the usefulness of several commonly used precipitation products over data scarce, complex mountainous terrain from a water resources perspective. Spatially averaged precipitation time series were generated or obtained for 16 sub-basins of the Paute river basin in the Ecuadorian Andes and 13 sub-basins of the Baker river basin in Chilean Patagonia. Precipitation time series were generated using the European Centre for Medium Weather Range Forecasting (ECMWF) 40year reanalysis (ERA-40) and the subsequent ERA-interim products, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset 1 (NCEP R1) hindcast products, as well as precipitation estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN). The Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B42 is also used for the Ecuadorian Andes. These datasets were compared to both spatially averaged gauged precipitation and river discharge. In general, the time series of the remotely sensed and hindcast products show a low correlation with locally observed precipitation data. Large biases are also observed between the different products. Hydrological verification based on river flows reveals that water balance errors can be extremely high for all evaluated products, including interpolated local data, in basins smaller than 1000km2.

abstract = {Despite the numerous hydrological models existing in hydrology we are limited to a few forms of conceptualization when abstracting hydrological systems into different model frameworks. Speaking in black and white terms, in most cases hydrological systems are either represented spatially lumped with conceptual models or spatially explicit with physically-based models. Physically-based models are often parameter-rich, making the parametrization challenging, while conceptual models are parsimonious, with only a few parameters needing to be identified. But this simplistic mathematical expression is often also their drawback since their model states and parameters are difficult to translate to the physical properties of a catchment. It is interesting to note that both hydrological modeling approaches often start with the drawing of a perceptual model. This follows the hydrologist's philosophy to separate dominant patterns and processes from idiosyncratic system details. Due to the importance of hillslopes as key landscape elements perceptual models are often displayed as 2D cross-sections. In this study we examine whether we can step beyond the qualitative character of perceptual models by using them as blueprint for setting up representative hillslope models. Thereby we test the hypothesis if a single hillslope can represent the functioning of an entire lower mesoscale catchment in a spatially aggregated way. We do this by setting up and testing two hillslope models in catchments located in two different geological settings, Schist and Marl, using a two-dimensional physically-based model. Both models are parametrized based on intensive field data and literature values without automatic calibration. Remarkably we are able to not only match the water balance of both catchments but further have some success in simulating runoff generation as well as soil moisture and sap flow dynamics. Particularly, our findings demonstrate that both models performed well during the winter season and clearly worse during the summer period. Virtual experiments revealed that this was most likely either due to a poor representation of the onset of vegetation in the Schist catchment or due to emergence of soil cracks in the Marl area. Both findings underpin that a static parameterization of hydrological models might be problematical in case of emergent behavior. Additional virtual experiments indicate that the storage of water in the bedrock and not so much the topographic gradient is a first order control on the hydrological functioning of the Schist catchment. We conclude that the representative hillslope concept is a feasible approach in data rich regions and that this form of abstraction provides an added value to the established conceptualization frameworks in hydrology.},

abstract = {By the analysis of the observed time series of streamflow from catchments, the main components of the underlying groundwater balance, namely, discharge, evapotranspiration loss, storage and recharge, can be identified and quantified. This holistic (as opposed to reductionist) estimation method is demonstrated for the Harris River catchment in southwest Western Australia. The relationship between the groundwater discharge and the reservoir storage of shallow unconfined aquifers was found to be nonlinear based on the analysis of numerous streamflow recession curves. However, depletion of groundwater by evapotranspiration losses, through the water uptake of tree roots, was found to bias the recession curves and the estimated reservoir parameters. As a result of the seasonality of both rainfall and potential evaporation, analysis of the recession curves, stratified according to time of the year, allowed the quantification of evapotranspiration loss as a function of calendar month and stored groundwater storage. Time series of recharge to the groundwater aquifer were computed from the observed total streamflows, and the estimated discharge and evapotranspiration losses, by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. Using traditional unit hydrograph methods unit recharge responses to rainfall were computed by least squares fitting. The shapes of the estimated unit response functions showed no significant seasonal variation.},

abstract = {We investigate how channel flow dynamics on real river networks produces scaling in peak flows. Scaling relations have been defined by log-log linearity between peak flow statistics and drainage areas for idealized mean self-similar networks like Peano and Mandelbrot Viscek. Unlike idealized basins, drainage areas and link lengths in real basins vary statistically. We use Horton-Strahler order as scale parameter instead of drainage area, and use the Hortonian framework to analyze these network structures. A river-network oriented GIS is used to extract the drainage network for the Walnut Gulch basin, Arizona in the United States. It provides the link connectivity structure and the geometric variables for numerically solving coupled link-based mass and momentum conservation equations. The equations are solved for spatially uniform and instantaneous injection of runoff under three different scenarios of flow in the channels: (1) Constant Velocity, (2) Constant Friction, and (3) Spatially Variable Friction. We find that Hortonian scaling in peak flows does not hold for the constant friction scenario. The scaling exponents of peak flows for the other two cases are larger than the scaling exponent of the peaks of the width functions. This property of scaling exponents for a real network is opposite to previous findings for idealized mean self-similar networks. An empirical scaling analysis of peak flows on the Walnut Gulch basin is briefly explained to provide preliminary empirical support to our theoretical findings. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The complex temporal heterogeneity of rainfall coupled with mountainous physiographic context makes a great challenge in the development of accurate short-term rainfall forecasts. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of multiple rainfall sources (gauge measurement, and radar and satellite products) for assimilation-based multi-sensor precipitation estimates and make multi-step-ahead rainfall forecasts based on the assimilated precipitation. Bias correction procedures for both radar and satellite precipitation products were first built, and the radar and satellite precipitation products were generated through the Quantitative Precipitation Estimation and Segregation Using Multiple Sensors (QPESUMS) and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS), respectively. Next, the synthesized assimilated precipitation was obtained by merging three precipitation sources (gauges, radars and satellites) according to their individual weighting factors optimized by nonlinear search methods. Finally, the multi-step-ahead rainfall forecasting was carried out by using the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The Shihmen Reservoir watershed in northern Taiwan was the study area, where 641 hourly data sets of thirteen historical typhoon events were collected. Results revealed that the bias adjustments in QPESUMS and PERSIANN-CCS products did improve the accuracy of these precipitation products (in particular, 30-60{\%} improvement rates for the QPESUMS, in terms of RMSE), and the adjusted PERSIANN-CCS and QPESUMS individually provided about 10{\%} and 24{\%} contribution accordingly to the assimilated precipitation. As far as rainfall forecasting is concerned, the results demonstrated that the ANFIS fed with the assimilated precipitation provided reliable and stable forecasts with the correlation coefficients higher than 0.85 and 0.72 for one- and two-hour-ahead rainfall forecasting, respectively. The obtained forecasting results are very valuable information for the flood warning in the study watershed during typhoon periods. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study proposes a stochastic approach to simulate sediment vertical dispersion in turbulent solid-liquid flows by developing a fractional advection-diffusion equation (fADE) to characterize the dynamics of sediment suspension. The fADE is a generalization of the traditional advection-diffusion equation (ADE) where the first-order spatial derivative is replaced with a fractional derivative of order ?? (0. {\textless}. ?????. 1). Many previous investigations of sediment suspension in steady sediment-laden flows apply the classic or improved Rouse equation, which was derived from the traditional ADE by assuming Fick's first law for the sediment dispersive flux. Recent observations in field and laboratory studies, however, have indicated that large errors may arise from the traditional ADE when applied to flows with coarse sediments. Instead, the vertical dispersion of suspended sediment is most likely a space nonlocal transport process in flows with turbulent bursting because particle vertical jumps with ejection events are no longer constrained to a small distance defined by the representative elementary volume. In other words, the vertical random displacements of suspended particles follow L??vy motion instead of Brownian motion. After validating against field measurements in the Las Vegas Wash as well as a set of published experimental data, we find that the proposed fractional model can describe the real-world vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration in steady turbulent flows. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The tests are made to examine the effects of the three new features on (i) a stochastic structure of the synthetic series, and on (ii) outputs fromCERES-Wheat crop model (crop yields) and SAC-SMArainfall-runoffmodel (monthly streamflow characteristics, distribution of 5-day streamflow) fed by the synthetic weather series. The results are compared with those obtained with the observed weather series. Results: (i) The inclusion of the annual cycle of the correlations has rather ambiguous effect on the temporal structure of the weather characteristics simulated by the generator and only insignificant effect on the output from either simulationmodel. (ii) Increased order of theMarkov chain improvesmodelling of precipitation occurrence series (especially long dry spells), and correspondingly improves reliability of the output from either simulation model. (iii) Conditioning the daily generator on monthly generator has the most positive effect, especially on the output fromthe hydrological model: Variability of themonthly streamflow characteristics and the frequency of extreme streamflows are better simulated. (iv) Of the two simulation models, the improvements related to the three modifications are more pronounced in the hydrological simulations.

Individually characterizing streamflow recessions often involves describing the similarities and differences between model parameters fitted to each recession time series. Significant methodological sensitivity has been identified in the fitting and parameterization of models that describe populations of many recessions, but the dependence of estimated model parameters on methodological choices has not been evaluated for event-by-event forms of analysis. Here, we use daily streamflow data from 16 catchments in northern California and southern Oregon to investigate how combinations of commonly used streamflow recession definitions and fitting techniques impact parameter estimates of a widely-used power-law recession model. We show that: (i) methodological decisions, including ones that have received little attention in the literature, can impact parameter value estimates and model goodness-of-fit; (ii) the central tendencies of event-scale recession parameter probability distributions are largely robust to methodological choices, in the sense that differing methods rank catchments similarly according to the medians of these distributions; (iii) recession parameter distributions are method-dependent, but roughly catchment-independent, such that changing the choices made about a particular method affects a given parameter in similar ways across most catchments; and (iv) the observed correlative relationship between the power law recession scale parameter and catchment antecedent wetness varies depending on recession definition and fitting choices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study we quantify the impact of rainfall spatial and temporal structure on the catchment hydrological response based on a numerical experiment. Rainfall ensembles generated using a state-of-the-art space-time stochastic model are used as input into a distributed process-based hydrological model. The sensitivity of the hydrograph to several structural characteristics of storm rainfall for three soil moisture initial conditions is numerically assessed at the basin outlet of an Alpine catchment in central Switzerland. The results highlight that the flood response is strongly affected by the temporal correlation of rainfall and to a lesser extent by its spatial variability. Initial soil moisture conditions play a paramount role in mediating the response. We identify the underlying mechanistic explanations in terms of runoff generation and connectivity of saturated areas that determine the sensitivity of flood response to the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall. We show that the element that mostly influences both the flood peak and the time of peak occurrence is the clustering of saturated areas in the catchment which leads to local enhanced runoff. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

HL-RMS consists of a well-tested conceptual water balance model applied on a regular spatial grid and physically-based kinematic routing models. A parameter estimation procedure that combines spatially-distributed and "integrated" at basin outlets properties is discussed. Initial tests using high-resolution radar precipitation estimates show that HL-RMS yields results comparable to well-calibrated lumped model simulations and outperforms a lumped model over basins where rainfall variability effects are significant. Combining outlet information and spatially-variable basin properties provides a reliable procedure to estimate distributed model parameters. While uniform adjustment of water balance model parameters provides reasonable results at basin outlets, the problem of removing scale effects in nested basins is still a challenge.},

abstract = {About 50–60{\%} of Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs) including nearly 85{\%} of intense hurricanes have their origins as African Easterly Waves (AEWs). However, predicting the likelihood of AEW intensification remains a difficult task. We have developed a Bayesian diagnostic methodology to understand genesis of North Atlantic TCs spawned by AEWs through the examination of the characteristics of the AEW itself together with the large-scale environment, resulting in a probabilistic discrimination between large-scale environments associated with intensifying and decaying AEWs. The methodology is based on a new objective and automatic AEW tracking scheme used for the period 1980 to 2001 based on spatio-temporally Fourier-filtered relative vorticity and meridional winds at different levels and outgoing long wave radiation. Using the AEW and Hurricane Best Track Files (HURDAT) data sets, probability density functions of environmental variables that discriminate between AEWs that decay, become TCs or become major hurricanes are determined. Results indicate that the initial amplitude of the AEWs is a major determinant for TC genesis, and that TC genesis risk increases when the wave enters an environment characterized by pre-existing large-scale convergence and moist convection. For the prediction of genesis, the most useful variables are column integrated heating, vertical velocity and specific humidity, and a combined form of divergence and vertical velocity and SST. It is also found that the state of the large-scale environment modulates the annual cycle and interannual variability of the AEW intensification efficiency.},

abstract = {Millions of hectares of cropland have slopes of less than 2{\%}, which can result in an enormous amount of pollutants transported with clay-silt sized particles via interrill erosion. However, few studies have attempted to understand the detachment-transport mechanism of particles with different wetting processes as determined by the surface soil cover of a field. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of different wetting rates on the runoff rate, temporal sediment particle size distribution (PSD), and sediment delivery rate produced via interrill erosion in low slopes under two contrasting tillage systems. Selected sites were under continuous corn rotations on Maury silt loam (Typic Paleudalf) or corn/soybean on Calloway silt (Aquic Fragiudult), both under either moldboard plow (MT) or no-till (NT) soil management. A nozzle-type rain simulator was used to deliver 87.5mmh-1 for 1h on a plot of 1m2. High kinetic energy wetting (HKE) was evaluated on a bare soil surface. Low kinetic energy wetting (LKE) was accomplished by covering the bare soil surface with layers of plastic mesh. Soil texture and aggregate stability were more important than overland flow in modifying the temporal PSD. Transport capacity appears to be diminished due to soil cover, making all predictions based on settling velocity ineffective. Comparison between HKE and LKE showed that soils can produce different temporal PSD in the sediment without changes in total soil loss. HKE increases both the total and temporal sediment delivery rate (Di) values. Observed differences in Di were consequences not of particle size but of the number of particles released. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

@article{Aghakouchak2010b,
abstract = {Precipitation is a major input in hydrological models. Radar rainfall data compared with rain gauge measurements provide higher spatial and temporal resolutions. However, radar data obtained form reflectivity patterns are subject to various errors such as errors in reflectivity-rainfall Z-R relationships, variation in vertical profile of reflectivity, and spatial and temporal sampling among others. Characterization of such uncertainties in radar data and their effects on hydrologic simulations is a challenging issue. The superposition of random error of different sources is one of the main factors in uncertainty of radar estimates. One way to express these uncertainties is to stochastically generate random error fields and impose them on radar measurements in order to obtain an ensemble of radar rainfall estimates. In the present study, radar uncertainty is included in the Z-R relationship whereby radar estimates are perturbed with two error components: purely random error and an error component that is proportional to the magnitude of rainfall rates. Parameters of the model are estimated using the maximum likelihood method in order to account for heteroscedasticity in radar rainfall error estimates. An example implementation of this approached is presented to demonstrate the model performance. The results confirm that the model performs reasonably well in generating an ensemble of radar rainfall fields with similar stochastic characteristics and correlation structure to that of unperturbed radar estimates.},

abstract = {Land use dynamics can have a significant impact on watershed hydrology. In this study, we develop a land use dynamics model coupled with a spatially distributed three-dimensional surface-subsurface hydrologic model. The coupled model is applied to the Bartin spring watershed, a rural watershed located in the northwestern Turkey. The land use dynamics model considers natural and anthropogenic transformations between land use categories classified as coniferous forests, deciduous forests, agriculture and settlement. The processes considered in the hydrodynamic model are evapotranspiration, overland flow, river channel flow, and saturated/unsaturated subsurface flow. The link between the land use model and the hydrodynamic model is through the vegetation parameters: leaf area index (LAI) and root depth (RD). The land use and hydrologic models were calibrated using satellite maps and daily flow and meteorological data, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed daily discharges for the considered watershed was about 0.72, indicating good agreement with observed data. The coupled model was used to simulate the water budget based on alternative land use and forest management scenarios. Results show that the water budget is most sensitive to variations in precipitation and conversion between forest and agricultural lands but is less sensitive to the type of forest stands. Overall, it is shown that the coupled model is a useful tool for assessing the impact of land use change on the watershed hydrological processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Kirkby1988,
abstract = {Hillslope hydrology is concerned with the partition of precipitation as it passes through the vegetation and soil between overland flow and subsurface flow. Flow follows routes which attenuate and delay the flow to different extents, so that a knowledge of the relevant mechanisms is important. In the 1960s and 1970s, hillslope hydrology developed as a distinct topic through the application of new field observations to develop a generation of physically based forecasting models. In its short history, theory has continually been overturned by field observation. Thus the current tendency, particularly among temperate zone hydrologists, to dismiss all Hortonian overland flow as a myth, is now being corrected by a number of significant field studies which reveal the great range in both climatic and hillslope conditions. Some recent models have generally attempted to simplify the processes acting, for example including only vertical unsaturated flow and lateral saturated flows. Others explicitly forecast partial or contributing areas. With hindsight, the most complete and distributed models have generally shown little forecasting advantage over simpler approaches, perhaps trending towards reliable models which can run on desk top microcomputers. The variety now being recognised in hillslope hydrological responses should also lead to models which take account of more complex interactions, even if initially with a less secure physical and mathematical basis than the Richards equation. In particular, there is a need to respond to the variety of climatic responses, and to spatial variability on and beneath the surface, including the role of seepage macropores and pipes which call into question whether the hillside can be treated as a Darcian flow system. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {Hydrologists have been struggling over the past decades to improve rainfall-runoff models. As a consequence, models proposed 20-30 years ago still keep evolving as progress is made in the understanding of catchment hydrological behaviour. Here we present the GR4J model, a daily lumped rainfall-runoff model which is the result of a continuous improvement process over the last 15 years. The article provides the mathematical formulation of a new four-parameter version of the model. Model performance is assessed on a large sample of catchments: compared to other rainfall-runoff models, the GR4J performance is among the best ones. It also gives better results than the previous three-parameter model version, especially in the simulation of low flows. The tests indicate that a four-parameter structure corresponds to the maximum level of complexity that could be afforded in the model. Adding more free parameters did not bring significant improvements. The gain in model robustness with this new version should enhance the confidence in the practical use of this simple model for water engineering and resource management. The discussion underlines the potential limits introduced in the modelling process when one relies on a priori concepts in building a model structure and it stresses the value of large catchment samples to assess models. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Deterministic and geostatistical interpolation methods were selected to generate time-series of daily and hourly average rainfall over a period of 10 years (2001-2010). These time-series were used as inputs for the HBV-TEC hydrological model and were individually calibrated against observed streamflow data. Based on model results, the performance of the deterministic methods can be said to be comparable to that of the geostatistical methods at daily time-steps. However, at hourly time-steps, deterministic methods considerably outperformed geostatistical methods.},

abstract = {Predictions in ungauged basins have been a major challenge in hydrologic sciences, and there is still much work needed to achieve robust and reliable predictions for such basins. Here, we propose and test a novel approach for predicting runoff from poorly gauged basins using a minimum complex model calibrated with isotope data alone (i.e., without observed discharge data). The model is composed of two water-stores (soil water and groundwater) and considers their connectivity to runoff in terms of both water and isotope budgets. In a meso-scale basin in which riverbed deformations frequently occur, making automatic observation of river discharge difficult, we measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition ($\delta$2H and $\delta$18O) of precipitation and river water twice-weekly for one year. Runoff predicted by the model agreed well with that observed monthly or bimonthly. Monte Carlo simulation revealed a strong coherence between model performance in isotope simulation and runoff prediction, demonstrating that the use of isotopes as dynamic proxies of calibration targets helps reliably constrain model parameters. Our results indicate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for prediction of runoff hydrographs, particularly for basins in which the stage-discharge relationship is highly variable.},

abstract = {The sediment load transported in a river is the most complex hydrological phenomenon due to a large number of obscure param- eters and the existence of both spatial variability of the basin characteristics and temporal climatic patterns. In this paper two artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed for semidistributed modeling of the suspended sediment load process of the Eel River watershed located in California. The first model was an integrated ANN model trained by the data of multiple stations inside the watershed. In the second model, a geomorphology-based ANN model, space-dependent geomorphologic parameters of the subbasins, extracted by geographic information system tools, accompanied by time-dependent meteorological data, were imposed on the network. In both models, three-layer perceptron neural networks were trained considering various combinations of input and hidden layers' neurons, and the optimum architectures of the models were selected according to the computed evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the ability of the models for spatio- temporal modeling of the process was examined through the cross-validation technique for a station. The obtained results demonstrate that although the predicted sediment load time series by both models are in satisfactory agreement with the observed data, the geomorphological ANN model produces better performance than an integrated model because it employs spatially variable factors of the subbasins as the model's inputs. Therefore, the model can operate as a nonlinear time-space regression tool rather than a fully lumped model.},

abstract = {A baseflow separation model called meteorology-corrected nonlinear reservoir algorithm (MNRA) was developed by combining nonlinear reservoir algorithm with a meteorological regression model, in which the effects of meteorological factors on daily baseflow recession were fully expressed. Using MNRA and the monitored data of daily streamflow and meteorological factors (including precipitation, evaporation, wind speed, water vapor pressure and relative humidity) from 2003 to 2012, we determined the daily, monthly, and yearly variations in baseflow from ChangLe River watershed, a typical rainy agricultural watershed in eastern China. Results showed that the estimated annual baseflow of the ChangLe River watershed varied from 18.8 cm (2004) to 61.9 cm (2012) with an average of 35.7 cm, and the baseflow index (the ratio of baseflow to streamflow) varied from 0.58 (2007) to 0.74 (2003) with an average of 0.65. Comparative analysis of different methods showed that the meteorological regression statistical model was a better alternative to the Fourier fitted curve for daily recession parameter estimation. Thus, the reliability and accuracy of the baseflow separation was obviously improved by MNRA, i.e., the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency increased from 0.90 to 0.98. Compared with the Kalinin's and Eckhardt's recursive digital filter methods, the MNRA approach could usually be more sensitive for baseflow response to precipitation and obtained a higher goodness-of-fit for streamflow recession, especially in the area with high-level shallow groundwater and frequent rain.},

abstract = {Determining surface soil moisture evolution over a range of scales remains a challenge because of multi-scale heterogeneity exhibited by soils. Measurement techniques are not in accordance with the scales at which information on soil moisture is needed. In situ point measurements are expensive and provide information only at a few select points. On the other hand, the spatial resolution of remote sensing data is too coarse for hydrologic applications. Currently, surface soil moisture evolution for heterogeneous fields subjected to rainfall conditions is achieved by a computationally intensive numerical solution of the Richards equation. To describe surface soil moisture evolution at local- and field-scale in an efficient manner, reference scaling curves are developed in this study based on a sharp front approximation and by adopting a log-normally distributed spatial hydraulic conductivity field. These scaling curves facilitate the determination of temporal evolution of surface soil moisture at any unmeasured location in the field, and can be used to obtain the field-scale surface soil moisture evolution for a single rainfall event. The scaling curves are computationally straight forward, and reduce the need for extensive soil moisture measurements at numerous locations in the field. Comparisons with experimental and numerical simulation results show that the proposed scaling curves hold promise for describing mean surface soil moisture evolution at the field-scale.},

abstract = {In this article's companion paper, flexible approaches for conceptual hydrological modeling at the catchment scale were motivated, and the SUPERFLEX framework, based on generic model components, was introduced. In this article, the SUPERFLEX framework and the ‘‘fixed structure'' GR4H model (an hourly version of the popular GR4J model) are applied to four hydrologically distinct experimental catchments in Europe and New Zealand. The estimated models are scrutinized using several diagnostic measures, ranging from statistical metrics, such as the statistical reliability and precision of the predictive distribution of streamflow, to more process-oriented diagnostics based on flow-duration curves and the correspondence between model states and groundwater piezometers. Model performance was clearly catchment specific, with a single fixed structure unable to accommodate intercatchment differences in hydrological behavior, including seasonality and thresholds. This highlights an important limitation of any ‘‘fixed'' model structure. In the experimental catchments, the ability of competing model hypotheses to reproduce hydrological signatures of interest could be interpreted on the basis of independent fieldwork insights. The potential of flexible frameworks such as SUPERFLEX is then examined with respect to systematic and stringent hypothesis-testing in hydrological modeling, for characterizing catchment diversity, and, more generally, for aiding progress toward a more unified formulation of hydrological theory at the catchment scale. When interpreted in physical process-oriented terms, the flexible approach can also serve as a language for dialogue between modeler and experimentalist, facilitating the understanding, representation, and interpretation of catchment behavior.},

abstract = {Success in the use of computer models for simulating environmental variables and processes requires objective model calibration and verification procedures. Several methods for quantifying the goodness-of-fit of observations against model-calculated values have been proposed but none of them is free of limitations and are often ambiguous. When a single indicator is used it may lead to incorrect verification of the model. Instead, a combination of graphical results, absolute value error statistics (i.e. root mean square error), and normalized goodness-of-fit statistics (i.e. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient, NSE) is currently recommended. Interpretation of NSE values is often subjective, and may be biased by the magnitude and number of data points, data outliers and repeated data. The statistical significance of the performance statistics is an aspect generally ignored that helps in reducing subjectivity in the proper interpretation of the model performance. In this work, approximated probability distributions for two common indicators (NSE and root mean square error) are derived with bootstrapping (block bootstrapping when dealing with time series), followed by bias corrected and accelerated calculation of confidence intervals. Hypothesis testing of the indicators exceeding threshold values is proposed in a unified framework for statistically accepting or rejecting the model performance. It is illustrated how model performance is not linearly related with NSE, which is critical for its proper interpretation. Additionally, the sensitivity of the indicators to model bias, outliers and repeated data is evaluated. The potential of the difference between root mean square error and mean absolute error for detecting outliers is explored, showing that this may be considered a necessary but not a sufficient condition of outlier presence. The usefulness of the approach for the evaluation of model performance is illustrated with case studies including those with similar goodness-of-fit indicators but distinct statistical interpretation, and others to analyze the effects of outliers, model bias and repeated data. This work does not intend to dictate rules on model goodness-of-fit assessment. It aims to provide modelers with improved, less subjective and practical model evaluation guidance and tools. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Some scientists argue, with reference to Popper's scientific philosophical school, that models cannot be verified or validated. Other scientists and many practitioners nevertheless use these terms, but with very different meanings. As a result of an increasing number of examples of model malpractice and mistrust to the credibility of models, several modelling guidelines are being elaborated in recent years with the aim of improving the quality of modelling studies. This gap between the views and the lack of consensus experienced in the scientific community and the strongly perceived need for commonly agreed modelling guidelines is constraining the optimal use and benefits of models. This paper proposes a framework for quality assurance guidelines, including a consistent terminology and a foundation for a methodology bridging the gap between scientific philosophy and pragmatic modelling. A distinction is made between the conceptual model, the model code and the site-specific model. A conceptual model is subject to confirmation or falsification like scientific theories. A model code may be verified within given ranges of applicability and ranges of accuracy, but it can never be universally verified. Similarly, a model may be validated, but only with reference to site-specific applications and to pre-specified performance (accuracy) criteria. Thus, a model's validity will always be limited in terms of space, time, boundary conditions and types of application. This implies a continuous interaction between manager and modeller in order to establish suitable accuracy criteria and predictions associated with uncertainty analysis. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Although it is broadly acknowledged that the radar-rainfall (RR) estimates based on the U. S. national network of Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) stations contain a high degree of uncertainty, no methods currently exist to inform users about its quantitative characteristics. The most comprehensive characterization of this uncertainty can be achieved by delivering the products in a probabilistic rather than the traditional deterministic form. The authors are developing a methodology for probabilistic quantitative precipitation estimation (PQPE) based on weather radar data. In this study, they present the central element of this methodology: an empirically based error structure model for the RR products. The authors apply a product-error-driven (PED) approach to obtain a realistic uncertainty model. It is based on the analyses of six years of data from the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, WSR-88D radar (KTLX) processed with the Precipitation Processing System algorithm of the NEXRAD system. The modeled functional-statistical relationship between RR estimates and corresponding true rainfall consists of two components: a systematic distortion function and a stochastic factor quantifying remaining random errors. The two components are identified using a nonparametric functional estimation apparatus. The true rainfall is approximated with rain gauge data from the Oklahoma Mesonet and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service Micronet networks. The RR uncertainty model presented here accounts for different time scales, synoptic regimes, and distances from the radar. In addition, this study marks the first time in which results on RR error correlation in space and time are presented.},

abstract = {Headwater catchments are important and often overlooked hydrologic components of drainage basins. Hydrologic response at different scales was evaluated during a period of increasing antecedent wetness in a steep, humid catchment in coastal Japan. Outflows from a second-order basin (EB, 15.7 ha), two first-order basins (B, 2.48 ha and A, 0.84 ha), a zero-order basin (0.25 ha), and a hillslope segment (0.0045 ha) were measured for nine individual storms prior to and during the typhoon season of 1992. Antecedent rainfall greatly influenced the dynamic contributions from various watershed components. During drier conditions at the beginning of the typhoon season, storm runoff was small ({\textless} 2.5{\%} of rainfall), largely generated by contributions from the narrow riparian zone. As wetness increased, subsurface flow from a hillslope segment contributed 2.0–3.4 times the runoff (on a unit contributing area basis) as the entire forest basin B. At least the lower 20{\%} of the hillslope appeared to contribute actively to subsurface stormflow during late season events with very wet antecedent conditions. During major storms with high antecedent moisture, macropore flow comprised more than 25{\%} of total subsurface flow during the peak and recession limbs of hydrographs. Almost no macropore flow occurred during storms with dry antecedent conditions. Zero-order basins with shallow soils appear to contribute to stormflow once a threshold of saturation is reached; after this point these geomorphic hollows contribute similar magnitudes of flow (per unit area) as subsurface hillslope drainage. Water yields during the two largest storms (with wet antecedent conditions) were higher in basin EB (16.6–25.6{\%}) than in basin B (11.6–19.5{\%}), partly owing to reduced canopy interception in the cutover portion of EB. During the two smallest storms (dry antecedent conditions) the opposite pattern occurred, likely because of the limited contributing area of stormflow near the stream channel. The dynamic hydrologic contributions of the near-channel zone, hillslope soils, and zero-order basins with respect to antecedent moisture and storm intensity offer new insights into the variable source area concept of streamflow generation and supplement more recent streamflow generation studies based on tracer tests.},

We observed chloride concentrations of up to 25{\%} of the concentration of seawater in streams of Maryland, New York, and New Hampshire during winters, and chloride concentrations remaining up to 100 times greater than unimpacted forest streams during summers. Mean annual chloride concentration increased as a function of impervious surface and exceeded tolerance for freshwater life in suburban and urban watersheds.

@article{Krakauer2011,
abstract = {The pattern of streamflow recession after rain events offers clues about the relationship between watershed runoff (observable as river discharge) and water storage (not directly observable) and can help in water resource assessment and prediction. However, there have been few systematic assessments of how streamflow recession varies across flow rates and how it relates to independent assessments of terrestrial water storage. We characterized the streamflow recession pattern in 61 relatively undisturbed small watersheds (1-100 km(2)) across the coterminous United States with multiyear records of hourly streamflow from automated gauges. We used the North American Regional Reanalysis to help identify periods where precipitation, snowmelt, and evaporation were small compared to streamflow. The order of magnitude of the recession timescale increases from 1 day at high flow rates (similar to 1 mm h(-1)) to 10 days at low flow rates (similar to 0.01 mm h(-1)), leveling off at low flow rates. There is significant variability in the recession timescale at a given flow rate between basins, which correlates with climate and geomorphic variables such as the ratio of mean streamflow to precipitation and soil water infiltration capacity. Stepwise multiple regression was used to construct a six-variable predictive model that explained some 80{\%} of the variance in recession timescale at high flow rates and 30-50{\%} at low flow rates. Seasonal and interannual variability in inferred storage shows similar time evolution to regional-scale water storage variability estimated from GRACE satellite gravity data and from land surface modeling forced by observed meteorology, but is up to a factor of 10 smaller. Study of this discrepancy in the inferred storage amplitude may provide clues to the range of validity of the recession curve approach to relating runoff and storage.},

abstract = {In this paper we extend the usefulness of the TOPKAPI model by adding a Green-Ampt infiltration module and make the model and source code freely available on the internet as PyTOPKAPI. Then, we investigate the sensitivity of the PyTOPKAPI hydrological model to systematic bias in the variables rainfall and evapotranspiration, as well as the physically based soil properties that describe the model behaviour. The model sensitivity is assessed in terms of relative changes in the Soil Saturation Index (SSI), which is defined as the percentage of soil pore space filled by water. The volumetric soil moisture content, can be calculated from SSI using location dependent soil properties, if required.The model sensitivity is calculated at 7200 sites in South Africa, for a 2.5 year simulation period with a time-step of three hours. This large spatial extent gives results for a wide array of climates and land properties. Overall, the sensitivity of the model turns out to be a closely linear function of, and the same order of magnitude as (or less than), the forcing/parameter bias. This indicates that the model is robust to errors in forcing/parameters.The results also show that the best estimates of soil water can be obtained by improving estimates of the storage parameters and rainfall forcing. However, the storage parameters must be obtained from static soil property data-sets and we show that there is value in making improvements to the rainfall forcing (in this case TRMM 3B42RT) for places where it is biased relative to observed rainfall.This work is particularly relevant for model application in ungauged basins, where the quality of forcing variables and physical parameters cannot be calibrated. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of the power law relationship between dQ / dt and Q for recession periods (-dQ / dt = kQ??, Q being discharge at the basin outlet at time t) clearly hints at the existence of a dominant recession flow process that is common to all real basins. It is commonly assumed that a basin, during recession events, functions as a single phreatic aquifer resting on a impermeable horizontal bed or the Dupuit-Boussinesq (DB) aquifer, and with time different aquifer geometric conditions arise that give different values of ?? and k. The recently proposed alternative model, geomorphological recession flow model, however, suggests that recession flows are controlled primarily by the dynamics of the active drainage network (ADN). In this study we use data for several basins and compare the above two contrasting recession flow models in order to understand which of the above two factors dominates during recession periods in steep basins. Particularly, we do the comparison by selecting three key recession flow properties: (1) power law exponent ??, (2) dynamic dQ / dt-Q relationship (characterized by k) and (3) recession timescale (time period for which a recession event lasts). Our observations suggest that neither drainage from phreatic aquifers nor evapotranspiration significantly controls recession flows. Results show that the value of ?? and recession timescale are not modeled well by DB aquifer model. However, the above mentioned three recession curve properties can be captured satisfactorily by considering the dynamics of the ADN as described by geomorphological recession flow model, possibly indicating that the ADN represents not just phreatic aquifers but the organization of various sub-surface storage systems within the basin. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Tarboton1989,
abstract = {This work examines patterns of regularity and scale in landform and channel networks. Digital elevation model data sets from throughout the United States are used as a data source. First we consider the two-dimensional planform properties of channel networks. We find that networks as a whole may be regarded as space filling fractals, ie.., with fractal dimension 2. The scaling may be described by Horton's laws and provides a link between Horton length and bifurcation ratios. Second we focus on elevation where the mean slope of rivers is characterized by a power law scaling with area. Investigations have recently used this to suggest that channel slopes are self-similar with magnitude or area as a scaling index. Our data indicates otherwise; in particular the variance of channel slope is larger than that predicted by simple self-similarity. The coefficient of variation of link slopes increases with area contributing to the link. This suggests multi-scaling. The scaling exponent for the standard deviation is approximately half the corresponding exponent in the relationship of the slope mean to magnitude or area. A model for channel slopes based on a point process of elevation drops along the channel is suggested. This model reproduces the observed multi-scaling properties when the density of elevation increments is related to area (or magnitude) as A- 0. This scaling cannot hold in the limit of small area and must break at some point. We suggest that this break defines the lower bound scale for which channels exist and can therefore be used to determine the drainage density, the basic horizontal length scale associated with the dissection of the landscape by the channel network. This break in scale can also be detected as a break in the constant drop property, namely the empirical fact that the elevation drop along Strahler streams is on average constant. That the break in scale gives drainage density is justified using a stability analysis of landform development processes and empirical comparison of drainage densities from many DEM data sets. This work provides a rational way to extract channel networks with physically justifiable drainage density from digital elevation models.},

abstract = {In six independent multiyear simulations of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM3) coupled to the NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM 1.0), the Mississippi River Basin stands out as a region in which surface air temperature is, during summer months, negatively correlated with soil water and precipitation. To determine if these correlations represent, in part, a land surface feedback in which wet soils caused by high rates of precipitation lead to higher latent heat fluxes, creating a cooler, moister atmosphere, and vice versa, several experiments in which soil water was initialized to either wet (saturated) or dry (wilting point) were performed. In an ensemble of five wet and five dry 60-day simulations for summer conditions, initially wet soils resulted in cold surface air temperature compared to initially dry soils. Latent heat flux increased and sensible heat flux decreased in the wet experiment compared to the dry experiment only for the first 30 days even though the surface was colder and wetter than the dry experiment throughout the full 60 days. Precipitation increased for the initially wet soils compared to the dry soils over much of the Mississippi River Basin, but only during the first 30 days. This increase was small, and most of the increased flux of water into the atmosphere was advected out of the region. The magnitude of the wet-dry signal depended on the manner in which soil water limited evapotranspiration. A step-function response, in which soil water did not limit evapotranspiration until near wilting point, produced a stronger signal than a linear ramping function scaled between field capacity and wilting point. These results suggest that soil moisture feedbacks amplify the severity and persistence of floods and droughts and that the manner in which soil water limits evapotranspiration, which is poorly understood, is a key control of this response.},

Geographical variations in the relative strengths of these factors, which can be established through analysis of model diagnostics, lead to geographical variations in simulated soil moisture memory.

abstract = {Methodologies for developing a macro-scale model of subsurface stormflow generation on a steep forested catchment in Japan are addressed. Field studies on this catchment have indicated that subsurface flow, consisting mainly of 'old' water displaced by 'new' rain water, dominates the storm response. Detailed field measurements on the catchment allowed simple, catchment-scale relationships to be developed between the volume of saturated groundwater, on the one hand, and discharge, and surface and subsurface saturated areas, on the other. Attempts are made to find linkages between these empirical relationships and physically-based descriptions of hydrological processes operating at smaller scales. A distributed model based on the saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow on steep catchments was developed and tested with field data collected on this catchment. Derivation of catchment-scale relationships can be carried out by a straightforward integration of the distributed model output. An alternative disaggregation-aggregation approach is presented, whereby the catchment is divided into a number of hillslope flow strips. By applying the distributed model on each flow strip, under steady-state conditions, it is possible to infer the spatial variability of groundwater volume in the various flow strips. This variability is related to a measure of hillslope topography and geometry. Knowing the catch-ment topography and geometry for any catchment, it is then possible to derive useful catchment-scale relationships which are applicable under quasi-steady-state conditions, Hydrological relationships derived in this manner are compared with corresponding empirical relationships. The methodologies presented are effective for understanding the linkages between catchment scale response and small-scale flow processes.},

abstract = {Flash floods cause some of the most severe natural disasters in Europe but Mediterranean areas are especially vulnerable. They can cause devastating damage to property, infrastructures and loss of human life. The complexity of flash flood generation processes and their dependency on different factors related to watershed properties and rainfall characteristics make flash flood prediction a difficult task. In this study, as part of the EU-FLASH project, we used an uncalibrated hydrological model to simulate flow events in a 27km2 Mediterranean watershed in Israel to analyze and better understand the various factors influencing flows. The model is based on the well-known SCS curve number method for rainfall-runoff calculations and on the kinematic wave method for flow routing. Existing data available from maps, GIS and field studies were used to define model parameters, and no further calibration was conducted to obtain a better fit between computed and observed flow data. The model rainfall input was obtained from the high temporal and spatial resolution radar data adjusted to rain gauges. Twenty flow events that occurred within the study area over a 15year period were analyzed. The model shows a generally good capability in predicting flash flood peak discharge in terms of their general level, classified as low, medium or high (all high level events were correctly predicted). It was found that the model mainly well predicts flash floods generated by intense, short-lived convective storm events while model performances for low and moderate flows generated by more widespread winter storms were quite poor. The degree of urban development was found to have a large impact on runoff amount and peak discharge, with higher sensitivity of moderate and low flow events relative to high flows. Flash flood generation was also found to be very sensitive to the temporal distribution of rain intensity within a specific storm event. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper compares event-based and continuous hydrological modelling approaches for real-time forecasting of river flows. Both approaches are compared using a lumped hydrologic model (whose structure includes a soil moisture accounting (SMA) store and a routing store) on a data set of 178 French catchments. The main focus of this study was to investigate the actual impact of soil moisture initial conditions on the performance of flood forecasting models and the possible compensations with updating techniques. The rainfall-runoff model assimilation technique we used does not impact the SMA component of the model but only its routing part. Tests were made by running the SMA store continuously or on event basis, everything else being equal. The results show that the continuous approach remains the reference to ensure good forecasting performances. We show, however, that the possibility to assimilate the last observed flow considerably reduces the differences in performance. Last, we present a robust alternative to initialize the SMA store where continuous approaches are impossible because of data availability problems.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a flexible framework for conceptual hydrological modeling, with two related objectives: (1) generalize and systematize the currently fragmented field of conceptual models and (2) provide a robust platform for understanding and modeling hydrological systems. In contrast to currently dominant ‘‘fixed'' model applications, the flexible framework proposed here allows the hydrologist to hypothesize, build, and test different model structures using combinations of generic components. This is particularly useful for conceptual modeling at the catchment scale, where limitations in process understanding and data availability remain major research and operational challenges. The formulation of the model architecture and individual components to represent distinct aspects of catchment-scale function, such as storage, release, and transmission of water, is discussed. Several numerical strategies for implementing the model equations within a computationally robust framework are also presented. In the companion paper, the potential of the flexible framework is examined with respect to supporting more systematic and stringent hypothesis testing, for characterizing catchment diversity, and, more generally, for aiding progress toward more unified hydrological theory at the catchment scale.},

abstract = {Prediction of streamflow at ungauged catchments requires transfer of hydrologic information (e.g., model parameters, hydrologic indices, streamflow values) from gauged (donor) to ungauged (receiver) catchments. A com- mon metric used for the selection of ideal donor catchments is the spatial proximity between donor and receiver catch- ments. However, it is not clear whether information trans- fer among nearby catchments is suitable across a wide range of climatic and geographic regions. We examine this issue using the data from 756 catchments within the continen- tal United States. Each catchment is considered ungauged in turn and daily streamflow is simulated through distance- based interpolation of streamflows from neighboring catch- ments. Results show that distinct geographic regions exist in US where transfer of streamflow values from nearby catch- ments is useful for retrospective prediction of daily stream- flow at ungauged catchments. Specifically, the high pre- dictability catchments (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency NS{\textgreater}0.7) are confined to the Appalachian Mountains in eastern US, the Rocky Mountains, and the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. Low predictability catchments (NS{\textless}0.3) are lo- cated mostly in the drier regions west of Mississippi river, which demonstrates the limited utility of gauged catchments in those regions for predicting at ungauged basins. The re- sults suggest that high streamflow similarity among nearby catchments (and therefore, good predictability at ungauged catchments) is more likely in humid runoff-dominated re- gions than in dry evapotranspiration-dominated regions. We further find that higher density and/or closer distance of gauged catchments near an ungauged catchment does not necessarily guarantee good predictability at an ungauged catchment.},

abstract = {The usefulness of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) as a highly accurate method for determining the soil thickness distribution on hillslopes was validated by combining intensive measurements using invasive methods, i.e., cone penetration testing and boreholes, with ERI in three granitic watersheds. Areas of high electrical resistivity ($\rho$) contrast reflecting soil-bedrock interfaces were found in all three study watersheds. However, $\rho$ values of soil and weathered granite just below the soil mantle varied over a relatively wide range at each site, as well as considerably from site to site. The patterns of low-high contrast in $\rho$ profiles, reflecting the soil-bedrock interface, also differed from site to site despite similarly dry conditions. Differences in the water retention characteristics of soil and weathered granitic bedrock, as found by a previous study of bedrock hydrological properties, may have been a major factor in the observed subsurface $\rho$ variations. The ERI method, with electrode spacing of 0.5 to 2.0m, was successful in determining soil thickness distributions ranging from about 0.5 to 3m depth based on its ability to detect high contrast in $\rho$ in the subsurface zone. Closer electrode spacings are expected to more sensitively reveal the distribution of ground material properties and thus more accurately replicate the soil-bedrock interface. ERI failed to clearly identify the soil-bedrock interface at some points along our measurement lines because of local intermediate materials with different properties such as unconsolidated soil and clayey intermediation just below the soil-bedrock interface. Two types of seismic survey (SS) techniques were also used, combining seismic refraction (SR) and the surface wave method (SWM) with the ERI method in a granitic watershed to compare ERI with other geophysical methods. The profile of S-wave velocity (V s) by SWM also reasonably duplicated the soil-bedrock interface; the V s profile showed larger variation in lateral direction and corresponded to the soil thickness distribution better than the P-wave velocity (V p) profile by SR. The combined use of ERI and SWM may be more effective in detecting the soil-bedrock interface because each method compensates for the deficiencies of the other method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Ferket2010,
abstract = {An important tool in the management of floods is the use of rainfall-runoff models to predict the arrival of discharge peaks. These models generally use rainfall and potential evapotranspiration rates as input, and relate these to the catchment discharge through a number of conceptual equations. The parameters of these equations are estimated through a comparison of the modeled discharge to the observations. Only one variable, catchment discharge, is thus generally used to calibrate and validate these models. The objective of this paper is to validate the internal model dynamics of two widely used rainfall-runoff models using baseflow estimates. The baseflow time series used in this paper are obtained through the use of a physically-based digital baseflow filter. These models, the Hydrologiska Byr??ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model and the Probability Distributed Model (PDM), were calibrated using 1 year of hourly discharge data. The HBV model uses a linear reservoir for the modeling of groundwater flow, while the PDM uses a cubic reservoir for this purpose. In order to assess the impact of the type of reservoir choice, the cubic reservoir in the PDM was also replaced by a linear reservoir. Two different parameter estimation algorithms were used for model calibration. The Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm minimizes the Root Mean Square Error between the model simulations and the observations, while Multistart Weight-Adaptive Recursive Parameter Estimation (MWARPE) uses the Extended Kalman Filter equations in an iterative, Monte-Carlo framework. MWARPE was found to lead to the best discharge simulations, but the differences with the results obtained from the SCE-UA algorithm were relatively small. When only the modeled discharge was analyzed, no clear picture emerged of which model produced the best results. However, it has been found that the replacement of the cubic groundwater reservoir in the PDM by a linear reservoir resulted in a strongly improved model performance with respect to the baseflow. Further, MWARPE consistently led to the best baseflow estimates for the three models, while the HBV model resulted in the best simulations of the baseflow, regardless of the calibration algorithm. The overall conclusion of this paper is that, even though it may be difficult to assess which model and calibration algorithm resulted in the best discharge estimates, the MWARPE calibration algorithm and the HBV model consistently led to the best internal model dynamics. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Stream gradients of mountain bedrock rivers in central Japan were examined using GIS and 50-m digital elevation models to discuss the distribution of knickzones. The gradients are classified into local and trend types based on the measurement lengths. The transition rate from the local to trend gradients, i.e. the decreasing rate of gradient with increasing measurement length, is then obtained as the indicator of relative steepness of a river segment, which permits the objective identification of fluvial knickzones. The identified knickzones occur widely in the study area, and indicate that the knickzone is one of the common landforms in Japanese mountain rivers. The knickzones are more abundant in steep upstream reaches of the rivers subjected to active erosion and rapid rock uplift. This suggests a hydraulic origin of the knickzones, which is similar to step-pool morphology but on a much larger scale. Some knickzones in piedmont areas can be, on the other hand, consistent with tectonic faulting at the mountain foot. Although some influences of volcanic activities on the formation of knickzones are observed, regional lithology seems to exert a relatively weak influence on the abundance of knickzones. Knickzones are more consistent with other local mechanisms of fluvial erosion, including reach-scale processes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An accurate recession curve model is important for separating individual flow events, which is especially difficult over catchments in regions with a maritime climate where frequent rainfall events cause the flows to rise before they reach the baseflow level. The traditional recession curve equations are based on static linear and nonlinear reservoir models. These models work quite well for ground water dominated recession curves, but not so well when the direct runoff is significant in the recession part. In this study, a new modelling methodology is explored based on self-adaptive parameters in the linear and nonlinear reservoir models. It has been found that the adaptive forms performed better than the static ones, especially when a window for the adaptive parameter estimation is properly selected. While the nonlinear adaptive model had better accuracy over the linear one, it could become unstable if its window is too narrow, indicating that more research work is needed to find an useful pattern for the window size. A comparison between the recession curve models and PDM model (a rainfall-runoff model) has shown that they agreed quite well in most winter events, but less so in the summer. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For satellite products, CMORPH has the best spatial correlation (0.70) but largely underestimates the total rainfall accumulation. Compared to microwave ingested algorithms, the IR-dominant algorithms provide a better estimation of the total rainfall accumulation but poorly resolve the temporal evolution of the warm cloud typhoon, especially for a large overestimation at the early storm stage. This study suggests that the best performance comes from the ground radar estimates that could be used as an alternative in case of the gauge denial. However, the current satellite rainfall products still have limitations in terms of resolution and accuracy, especially for this type of extreme typhoon. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Storage of water within a river basin is often estimated by analyzing recession flow curves as it cannot be 'instantly' estimated with the aid of available technologies. In this study we explicitly deal with the issue of estimation of 'drainable' storage, which is equal to the area under the 'complete' recession flow curve (i.e. a discharge vs. time curve where discharge continuously decreases till it approaches zero). But a major challenge in this regard is that recession curves are rarely 'complete' due to short inter-storm time intervals. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and model recession flows meaningfully. We adopt the well-known Brutsaert and Nieber analytical method that expresses time derivative of discharge (dQ/dt) as a power law function of Q:-dQ/dt=kQ{\textless}sup{\textgreater}??{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. However, the problem with dQ/dt-Q analysis is that it is not suitable for late recession flows. Traditional studies often compute ?? considering early recession flows and assume that its value is constant for the whole recession event. But this approach gives unrealistic results when ?????2, a common case. We address this issue here by using the recently proposed geomorphological recession flow model (GRFM) that exploits the dynamics of active drainage networks. According to the model, ?? is close to 2 for early recession flows and 0 for late recession flows. We then derive a simple expression for drainable storage in terms the power law coefficient k, obtained by considering early recession flows only, and basin area. Using 121 complete recession curves from 27 USGS basins we show that predicted drainable storage matches well with observed drainable storage, indicating that the model can also reliably estimate drainable storage for 'incomplete' recession events to address many challenges related to water resources.},

abstract = {The simple dynamical system approach was implemented to analyze, explain and simulate streamflow fluxes in diverse seasonal hydrological conditions within the forested Pade{\v{z}} stream catchment in SW Slovenia. The catchment is characterized by the flushing, torrential hydrological response conditioned by the flysch geological settings of a low hydraulic conductivity. Consequently, the streamflow formation is not controlled solely by the deeper subsurface catchment storage but is also strongly influenced by the rainfall–runoff that bypasses the deeper subsurface part of the total catchment storage. Therefore, fast component of the streamflow is identified using two-component hydrograph separation; the component recession behavior is described by a separate sensitivity function and used in a simple model to simulate the streamflow. According to the simulation results, the Pade{\v{z}} stream catchment behaves primarily like a deeper subsurface storage-dependent system during most of the hydrological conditions. When rainfall intensities increase (rainfall intensities close to 10mm/h or higher), triggering of the secondary streamflow formation mechanism described by separate, bypassing flow sensitivity function becomes evident and causes fast hydrograph formation with steeply rising and falling limbs. To be able to implement the modeling concept for streamflow predictions, the rainfall losses, most likely associated with interception losses not covered under the potential evapotranspiration calculation, would have to be more thoroughly analyzed through rainfall interception measurements. Our study shows the possible way that two hydrological concepts, the streamflow recession analysis and the two-component hydrograph separation based on relatively easily measurable tracers, such as electrical conductivity, could be combined for analyzing streamflow fluxes.},

abstract = {Recession analysis across scales can provide insight into the spatial aggregation of hydrologic processes. Accordingly, we analyzed individual late-time recession curves from 25 nested USGS stream gauges over a period of {\~{}}150days with negligible precipitation during the 2012-2013 North American drought. These gauges are located in the Iowa and Cedar River basins and drain areas ranging from {\~{}}70 to 17,000km2. Our data analyses show that these late-time recession processes can be represented by a linear reservoir model with a constant recession time scale of about 34days, indicating linear and homogeneous recession behaviors at the large scales investigated. However, others have shown that the early-time recession process becomes more nonlinear as spatial scale and, thus, spatial variability increases. We developed a distributed drainage model as a diagnostic tool to understand these seemingly contradictory recession characteristics at multiple spatial scales and different stages. With a hierarchical description of the recession variability at the hillslope scale, our model can simultaneously produce the increasing nonlinear early-time and the linear and homogenous late-time recession behaviors at larger scales. The hierarchical representation classifies hillslopes according to the Strahler orders of the stream links into which they drain. We postulate that a larger difference in recession behaviors will occur between hillslopes from different orders than between those from the same order. Overall, this study shows how the spatial randomness and nonrandomness of small-scale process variability control the hydrologic responses at larger scales and suggests a combined (nonrandom-random) representation of watersheds for aggregating hydrologic processes.},

abstract = {State updating of distributed rainfall-runoff models via streamflow assimilation is subject to overfitting because large dimensionality of the state space of the model may render the assimilation problem seriously under-determined. To examine the issue in the context of operational hydrology, we carry out a set of real-world experiments in which streamflow data is assimilated into gridded Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) and kinematic-wave routing models of the US National Weather Service (NWS) Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM) with the variational data assimilation technique. Study basins include four basins in Oklahoma and five basins in Texas. To assess the sensitivity of data assimilation performance to dimensionality reduction in the control vector, we used nine different spatiotemporal adjustment scales, where state variables are adjusted in a lumped, semi-distributed, or distributed fashion and biases in precipitation and potential evaporation (PE) are adjusted hourly, 6-hourly, or kept time-invariant. For each adjustment scale, three different streamflow assimilation scenarios are explored, where streamflow observations at basin interior points, at the basin outlet, or at both interior points and the outlet are assimilated. The streamflow assimilation experiments with nine different basins show that the optimum spatiotemporal adjustment scale varies from one basin to another and may be different for streamflow analysis and prediction in all of the three streamflow assimilation scenarios. The most preferred adjustment scale for seven out of nine basins is found to be the distributed, hourly scale, despite the fact that several independent validation results at this adjustment scale indicated the occurrence of overfitting. Basins with highly correlated interior and outlet flows tend to be less sensitive to the adjustment scale and could benefit more from streamflow assimilation. In comparison to outlet flow assimilation, interior flow assimilation at any adjustment scale produces streamflow predictions with a spatial correlation structure more consistent with that of streamflow observations. We also describe diagnosing the complexity of the assimilation problem using the spatial correlation information associated with the streamflow process, and discuss the effect of timing errors in a simulated hydrograph on the performance of the data assimilation procedure.},

abstract = {Most studies to date in the humid tropics have described a similar pattern of rapid translation of rainfall to runoff via overland flow and shallow subsurface stormflow. However, study sites have been few overall, and one particular system has received very little attention so far: tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) on volcanic substrate. While TMCFs provide critical ecosystem services, our understanding of runoff generation processes in these environments is limited. Here, we present a study aimed at identifying the dominant water sources and pathways and mean residence times of soil water and streamflow for a first-order, TMCF catchment on volcanic substrate in central eastern Mexico. During a 6-week wetting-up cycle in the 2009 wet season, total rainfall was 1200 mm and storm event runoff ratios increased progressively from 11 to 54{\%}. With the increasing antecedent wetness conditions, our isotope and chemical-based hydrograph separation analysis showed increases of pre-event water contributions to the storm hydrograph, from 35 to 99{\%}. Stable isotope-based mean residence times estimates showed that soil water aged only vertically through the soil profile from 5 weeks at 30 cm depth to 6 months at 120 cm depth. A preliminary estimate of 3 years was obtained for base flow residence time. These findings all suggest that shallow lateral pathways are not the controlling processes in this tropical forest catchment; rather, the high permeability of soils and substrate lead to vertical rainfall percolation and recharge of deeper layers, and rainfall-runoff responses appeared to be dominated by groundwater discharge from within the hillslope.},

abstract = {Using 30. years (1979-2009) of data from 33 automatic rain gauges in the Netherlands, a study of the space-time variability of rainfall is performed. This study uses 90-day averaged semi-variograms to find seasonal signals in the fitted spherical semi-variogram parameters of rainrates in the Netherlands, for accumulation intervals between 1 and 24. h. These signals can be well-described by simple cosine functions. The dependence of these cosine functions on the accumulation interval is modeled in two different ways: (1) power-law relations between the variogram parameters and the accumulation interval, and (2) power-law relations between the parameters of the cosine functions and the accumulation interval. For the first method the cosine function at the 24-h accumulation interval is also needed. The second of these methods has more parameters, but is shown to model the temporal scaling best. The space-time scaling relations found in this paper are compared to those found by others for similar and contrasting climates. Seasonality is shown to play an important role in determining rainfall spatial variability. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Urban catchments are typically characterised by high spatial variability and fast runoff processes resulting in short response times. Hydrological analysis of such catchments requires high resolution precipitation and catchment information to properly represent catchment response. This study investigated the impact of rainfall input resolution on the outputs of detailed hydrodynamic models of seven urban catchments in North-West Europe. The aim was to identify critical rainfall resolutions for urban catchments to properly characterise catchment response. Nine storm events measured by a dual-polarimetric X-band weather radar, located in the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR) of the Netherlands, were selected for analysis. Based on the original radar estimates, at 100 m and 1 min resolutions, 15 different combinations of coarser spatial and temporal resolutions, up to 3000 m and 10 min, were generated. These estimates were then applied to the operational semi-distributed hydrodynamic models of the urban catchments, all of which have similar size (between 3 and 8 km2), but different morphological, hydrological and hydraulic characteristics. When doing so, methodologies for standardising model outputs and making results comparable were implemented. Results were analysed in the light of storm and catchment characteristics. Three main features were observed in the results: (1) the impact of rainfall input resolution decreases rapidly as catchment drainage area increases; (2) in general, variations in temporal resolution of rainfall inputs affect hydrodynamic modelling results more strongly than variations in spatial resolution; (3) there is a strong interaction between the spatial and temporal resolution of rainfall input estimates. Based upon these results, methods to quantify the impact of rainfall input resolution as a function of catchment size and spatial-temporal characteristics of storms are proposed and discussed.},

abstract = {Soil moisture refers to the water present in the uppermost part of a field soil and is a state variable controlling a wide array of ecological, hydrological, geotechnical, and meteorological processes. The literature on soil moisture is very extensive and is developing so rapidly that it might be considered ambitious to seek to present the state of the art concerning research into this key variable. Even when covering investigations about only one aspect of the problem, there is a risk of some inevitable omission. A specific feature of the present essay, which may make this overview if not comprehensive at least of particular interest, is that the reader is guided through the various traditional and more up-to-date methods by the central thread of techniques developed to measure soil moisture interwoven with applications of modeling tools that exploit the observed datasets.This paper restricts its analysis to the evolution of soil moisture at the local (spatial) scale. Though a somewhat loosely defined term, it is linked here to a characteristic length of the soil volume investigated by the soil moisture sensing probe. After presenting the most common concepts and definitions about the amount of water stored in a certain volume of soil close to the land surface, this paper proceeds to review ground-based methods for monitoring soil moisture and evaluates modeling tools for the analysis of the gathered information in various applications. Concluding remarks address questions of monitoring and modeling of soil moisture at scales larger than the local scale with the related issue of data aggregation. An extensive, but not exhaustive, list of references is provided, enabling the reader to gain further insights into this subject.},

abstract = {Hydrograph separation of runoff events in two nested alpine/subalpine basins in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia was carried out using electrical conductivity, specific concentrations of silica and the stable isotopes oxygen-18 and deuterium as hydrological tracers. The methods predicted consistent high pre-storm water contribution for the subalpine site (60-90{\%}) but more variable contribution at the alpine basin outlet (25-90{\%}). The pre-storm water contribution is much larger than had previously been expected. Precipitation is believed to run off as overland flow due to the steep slopes in combination with the hydrophobic soils until it can enter the subsurface environment. The rapid influx of stored water is possibly caused by pressure propagation in the macropore system which could be enhanced by the heavily fractured bedrock and permeable landslide debris acting as efficient hydrological conduits. The study suggests that alternative hydrological tracers such as electrical conductivity and silica concentration can be used under certain hydrological and lithological conditions. These alternative tracers should, however, be verified against more conventional tracers before use, as the behaviour depends on specific characteristics of each basin. At the upper basin outlet, both electrical conductivity (EC) and silica underestimated the pre-storm contribution. At the lower station, silica and EC showed a similar pattern to deuterium and oxygen-18 tracers. The calculated pre-storm component using EC was, however, 10-20{\%} lower than the calculated values from the other three tracers. The advantage of using these alternative tracers is that hydrograph separation results can, a priori, be anticipated.},

For seven watersheds in New York State, USA ranging from 100km 2 to 6415km 2, we distinguish data points in the dQ/dt-Q plot belonging to individual recession events instead of looking at the entire data cloud. The recession curve of individual events consistently shifts upward during the summer and late fall (relative to spring and late fall curves) and much of the scatter in the data cloud appears to be due to seasonal variations in recession. We speculate that these seasonal variations in recession rate may be due to variations in watershed evapotranspiration (ET). Additionally, most individual recession events have slopes of approximately two when plotted as log dQ/dt versus logQ. Application of the Boussinesq Equation to watershed-scale recession date predicts slopes shifting from 3 to 3/2 as recession progresses, thus the observed slope of two casts doubt on whether it is appropriate to apply hydraulic aquifer theory to these types of watersheds to infer aquifer properties or predict low flows. As a further validation of the hydrologic information content of individual recession curves, the individual recession curves from time periods with minimal ET (early spring and late fall) were used to establish storage-discharge functions for two of the smaller watersheds. With these storage-discharge functions, a simple hydrologic model could reasonably simulate time series with minimal calibration (Nash-Sutcliffe R 2 of 0.71 and 0.67 on log transformed discharge). Overall, this paper suggests that the analysis of individual event recession curves (particularly when compared among watersheds and seasons) can be a valuable tool for gaining insights into hydrological processes at the scale of large watersheds and can justify alternatives to current low flow models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Soil erosion is a serious global problem requiring effective modeling for accurate assessment of sensitive areas and related erosion rates. The outcome of soil erosion models depends strongly on the estimation of sediment transport capacity. In most of the existing spatially distributed soil erosion models sediment transport capacity of overland flow is often estimated using stream flow transport capacity functions. The applicability of stream flow functions to overland flow conditions is questionable because hydraulic conditions like flow depth, slope steepness and surface roughness under overland flow are substantially different from stream flow conditions. Hence, the main objectives of this study were i) to check the suitability of five existing well known and widely used transport capacity functions (Yalin 1963; Low, 1989; Govers, 1990; modified Engelund and Hansen (Smith et al., 1995); and Abrahams et al., 2001) for use under overland flow conditions, and ii) to derive a new function based on unit stream power by dimensional analysis to quantify transport capacity for overland flow. To accomplish the objectives, experiments in a 3.0m long and 0.5m wide flume were carried out using four different sands (0.230, 0.536, 0.719, and 1.022mm). The unit discharges used for experimentation ranged from 0.07 to 2.07??10-3m2s-1 and slopes ranged from 5.2 to 17.6{\%}. In this study, none of the predictions with the existing functions was in good agreement with measured results over the whole range of experimental conditions, especially at low flow intensities. The percentages of observations in which the discrepancy ratio ranged between 0.5 and 2.0 were: 65{\%} (Yalin 1963), 74{\%} (Low, 1989), 57{\%} (Govers, 1990), 54{\%} (modified Engelund and Hansen (Smith et al., 1995)), and 25{\%} (Abrahams et al., 2001). The results showed that the selected functions reasonably estimate transport capacities only under those ranges of conditions for which they were formulated. Although the excess shear stress concept based function (i.e. Low's function) produced excellent results, the degree of accuracy of the results varied substantially with grain size (P.O.0.5-2.0: 53-100{\%}). In contrast, the performance of the Govers' function, which is based on the unit stream power concept, was quite similar for all the selected sands (P.O.0.5-2.0: 50-63{\%}). Based on the unit stream power concept, a new function for low flow intensities was derived by dimensional analysis using the data gained from the flume experiments. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Catchment modeling in areas dominated by active geomorphologic processes, such as soil erosion and landsliding, is often hampered by the lack of reliable methods for the spatial estimation of soil depth. In a catchment, soil thickness h can vary as a function of many different and interplaying factors, such as underlying lithology, climate, gradient, hillslope curvature, upslope contributing area, and vegetation cover, making the distributed estimation of h challenging and often unreliable. In this work we present an alternative methodology which links soil thickness to gradient, horizontal and vertical slope curvature, and relative position within the hillslope profile. While the relationship with gradient and curvature should reflect the kinematic stability of the regolith cover, allowing greater soil thicknesses over planar and concave areas, the distance from the hill crest (or from the valley bottom) accounts for the position within the soil toposequence. This last parameter is fundamental; points having equal gradient and curvature can have significantly different soil thickness due to their dissimilar position along the hillslope profile. The proposed model has been implemented in a geographic information system environment and tested in the Terzona Creek basin in central Italy. Results are in good agreement with field data (mean absolute error is 11 cm with 8.5 cm standard deviation) and average errors are lower than those obtained with other topography-based methods, where mean absolute error ranges from 47 cm for a model based on curvature, position, and slope gradient to 94 cm for a model based solely on slope gradient. As a further test, the predicted soil thickness was used to determine derived quantities, such as the factor of safety for landsliding potential. Our model, when compared to other empirical methods, returns the best results and, therefore, can improve the prediction of soil losses and sediment production when utilized in conjunction with hydrological and landsliding models.},

abstract = {Cities are increasingly vulnerable to floods generated by intense rainfall, because of urbanisation of flood-prone areas and ongoing urban densification. Accurate information of convective storm characteristics at high spatial and temporal resolution is a crucial input for urban hydrological models to be able to simulate fast runoff processes and enhance flood prediction in cities. In this paper, a detailed study of the sensitivity of urban hydrodynamic response to high resolution radar rainfall was conducted. Rainfall rates derived from X-band dual polarimetric weather radar were used as input into a detailed hydrodynamic sewer model for an urban catchment in the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The aim was to characterise how the effect of space and time aggregation on rainfall structure affects hydrodynamic modelling of urban catchments, for resolutions ranging from 100 to 2000 m and from 1 to 10 min. Dimensionless parameters were derived to compare results between different storm conditions and to describe the effect of rainfall spatial resolution in relation to storm characteristics and hydrodynamic model properties: rainfall sampling number (rainfall resolution vs. storm size), catchment sampling number (rainfall resolution vs. catchment size), runoff and sewer sampling number (rainfall resolution vs. runoff and sewer model resolution respectively). {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Results show that for rainfall resolution lower than half the catchment size, rainfall volumes mean and standard deviations decrease as a result of smoothing of rainfall gradients. Moreover, deviations in maximum water depths, from 10 to 30{\%} depending on the storm, occurred for rainfall resolution close to storm size, as a result of rainfall aggregation. Model results also showed that modelled runoff peaks are more sensitive to rainfall resolution than maximum in-sewer water depths as flow routing has a damping effect on in-sewer water level variations. Temporal resolution aggregation of rainfall inputs led to increase in de-correlation lengths and resulted in time shift in modelled flow peaks by several minutes. Sensitivity to temporal resolution of rainfall inputs was low compared to spatial resolution, for the storms analysed in this study.},

abstract = {No consensus has yet been reached regarding the influence of rainfall spatial variability on runoff modelling at catchment outlets. To eliminate modelling and measurement errors, in addition to controlling rainfall variability and both the characteristics and hydrological behaviour of catchments, we propose to proceed by simulation. We have developed a simulation chain that combines a stream network model, a rainfall simulator and a distributed hydrological model (with four production functions and a distributed transfer function). Our objective here is to use this simulation chain as a simplified test bed in order to better understand the impact of the spatial variability of rainfall forcing. We applied the chain to contrasted situations involving catchments ranging from a few tens to several hundreds of square km2, thus corresponding to urban and peri-urban catchments for which surface runoff constitutes the dominant process. The results obtained confirm that the proposed simulation approach is helpful to better understand the influence of rainfall spatial variability on the catchment response. We have shown that significant dispersion exists not only between the various simulation scenarios (defined by a rainfall configuration and a catchment configuration), but also within each simulation scenario. These results show that the organisation of rainfall during the study event over the study catchment plays an important role, leading us to examine rainfall variability indexes capable of summarising the influence of rainfall spatial organisation on the catchment response. Thanks to the simulation chain, we have tested the variability indexes of Zoccatelli et al. (2010) and improved them by proposing two other indexes.},

abstract = {This study presents an application of an inno- vative sampling strategy to assess soil moisture dynamics in a headwater of the Wei{\ss}eritz in the German eastern Ore Mountains. A grassland site and a forested site were in- strumented with two Spatial TDR clusters (STDR) that con- sist of 39 and 32 coated TDR probes of 60cm length. Dis- tributed time series of vertically averaged soil moisture data from both sites/ensembles were analyzed by statistical and geostatistical methods. Spatial variability and the spatial mean at the forested site were larger than at the grassland site. Furthermore, clustering of TDR probes in combination with long-term monitoring allowed identification of average spatial covariance structures at the small field scale for dif- ferent wetness states. The correlation length of soil water content as well as the sill to nugget ratio at the grassland site increased with increasing average wetness and but, in contrast, were constant at the forested site. As soil proper- ties at both the forested and grassland sites are extremely variable, this suggests that the correlation structure at the forested site is dominated by the pattern of throughfall and interception. We also found a very strong correlation be- tween antecedent soil moisture at the forested site and runoff coefficients of rainfall-runoff events observed at gauge Rehe- feld. Antecedent soil moisture at the forest site explains 92{\%} of the variability in the runoff coefficients. By combining these results with a recession analysis we derived a first con- ceptual model of the dominant runoff mechanisms operating in this catchment. Finally, we employed a physically based hydrological model to shed light on the controls of soil- and plant morphological parameters on soil average soil moisture at the forested site and the grassland site, respectively. A homogeneous soil setup allowed, after fine tuning of plant morphological parameters, most of the time unbiased predic- tions of the observed average soil conditions observed at both field sites. We conclude that the proposed sampling strategy of clustering TDR probes is suitable to assess unbiased aver- age soil moisture dynamics in critical functional units, in this case the forested site, which is a much better predictor for event scale runoff formation than pre-event discharge. Long term monitoring of such critical landscape elements could maybe yield valuable information for flood warning in head- waters. We thus think that STDR provides a good intersect of the advantages of permanent sampling and spatially highly resolved soil moisture sampling using mobile rods.},

Previous validation of automated baseflow separation techniques consisted only of comparisons with manual techniques. In this study, the automated digital filter technique was found to compare well with measured field estimates yielding a monthly coefficient of determination of 0.86. The recharge algorithm developed in this study is an automated derivation of the Rorabaugh hydrograph recession curve displacement method that utilizes daily streamflow. Comparison of annual recharge from field water balance measurements to those computed with the automated recession curve displacement method had coefficients of determination of 0.76 and predictive efficiencies of 71 percent. Monthly estimates showed more variation and are not advocated for use with this method. These techniques appear to be fast, reproducible methods for estimating baseflow and annual recharge and should be useful in regional modeling efforts and as a quick check on mass balance techniques for shallow water table aquifers.},

abstract = {HIRESSS (HIgh REsolution Slope Stability Simulator) is a physically based distributed slope stability simulator for analyzing shallow landslide triggering conditions in real time and on large areas using parallel computational techniques. The physical model proposed is composed of two parts: hydrological and geotechnical. The hydrological model receives the rainfall data as dynamical input and provides the pressure head as perturbation to the geotechnical stability model that computes the factor of safety (FS) in probabilistic terms. The hydrological model is based on an analytical solution of an approximated form of the Richards equation under the wet condition hypothesis and it is introduced as a modeled form of hydraulic diffusivity to improve the hydrological response. The geotechnical stability model is based on an infinite slope model that takes into account the unsaturated soil condition. During the slope stability analysis the proposed model takes into account the increase in strength and cohesion due to matric suction in unsaturated soil, where the pressure head is negative. Moreover, the soil mass variation on partially saturated soil caused by water infiltration is modeled. The model is then inserted into a Monte Carlo simulation, to manage the typical uncertainty in the values of the input geotechnical and hydrological parameters, which is a common weak point of deterministic models. The Monte Carlo simulation manages a probability distribution of input parameters providing results in terms of slope failure probability. The developed software uses the computational power offered by multicore and multiprocessor hardware, from modern workstations to supercomputing facilities (HPC), to achieve the simulation in reasonable runtimes, compatible with civil protection real time monitoring. A first test of HIRESSS in three different areas is presented to evaluate the reliability of the results and the runtime performance on large areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {Urban hydrology has evolved to improve the way urban runoff is managed for flood protection, public health and environmental protection. There have been significant recent advances in the measurement and prediction of urban rainfall, with technologies such as radar and microwave networks showing promise. The ability to predict urban hydrology has also evolved, to deliver models suited to the small temporal and spatial scales typical of urban and peri-urban applications. Urban stormwater management increasingly consider the needs of receiving environments as well as those of humans. There is a clear trend towards approaches that attempt to restore pre-development flow-regimes and water quality, with an increasing recognition that restoring a more natural water balance benefits not only the environment, but enhances the liveability of the urban landscape. Once regarded only as a nuisance, stormwater is now increasingly regarded as a resource. Despite the advances, many important challenges in urban hydrology remain. Further research into the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban rainfall is required to improve short-term rainfall prediction. The performance of stormwater technologies in restoring the water balance and in removing emerging priority pollutants remain poorly quantified. All of these challenges are overlaid by the uncertainty of climate change, which imposes a requirement to ensure that stormwater management systems are adaptable and resilient to changes. Urban hydrology will play a critical role in addressing these challenges. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable in hydrological processes. Although the combined effects of multiple climatic factors in different land cover conditions are highly valuable for water resource management, a complete understanding of these effects remains unclear. This study used a cluster analysis approach to investigate the combined effects of precipitation and air temperature, rather than a single factor, in different land covers for an area over the Poyang Lake Basin in China from 2003 to 2009. Specifically, monthly soil moisture was classified into eight clusters according to the change in precipitation and air temperature; the clusters describe a range of climates from the extreme of wet-hot to that of dry-cold. For an individual climate factor, our results showed that the contribution of air temperature to soil moisture is greater than that of precipitation, and the effect of air temperature is more sensitive in different land covers. When considering the combined effects of precipitation and air temperature, soil moisture varies with land cover; however, the variation in a normal climate cluster is greater than in an extreme climate cluster. This indicated that land cover is the dominant factor in soil moisture variation in normal climatic conditions, whereas climate is the dominant factor in extreme conditions. As climate shifts from the wet-hot to the dry-cold cluster, soil moisture decreases for all land covers, with the minimum rate occurring in forest conditions. Meanwhile, soil moisture deficit and saturation are more likely to occur in grassland and forest areas, indicating that forest cover might mitigate drought. The results of this study provide an effective approach to investigate the combined effects of climate factors on soil moisture for various land covers in humid areas. This study also supports the management of water resources in changing climates.},

abstract = {Oxygen-18 is a stable, naturally occurring isotope of oxygen, whose concentration in a particular rainfall event may be quite different from its concentration in groundwater. It is on the basis of this difference that storm hydrographs recorded at seven stream gauges in the Big Creek and Big Otter Creek basins of Southern Ontario were separated into their components as to source. The storm hydrographs considered in this study were the result of a severe spring storm that triggered devastating floods in the adjacent, heavily populated, Grand River drainage area. Using the oxygen-18 technique, it was found that groundwater was the major component of storm runoff, providing more than 50{\%} of the peak discharge. These results are consistent with natural tracer studies on basins one to two orders of magnitude smaller and in different hydro- geologic environments. By comparing oxygen-18 and specific conductivity data, storm runoff was divided into groundwater, direct rainfall, and direct runoff components. On the basis of the oxygen-18 and specific conductivity data, it was concluded that storm runoff in the study area was generated primarily through increased groundwater discharge. It is believed that increased hydraulic gradients, near or at the stream channel, which develop quickly after a rainfall, are responsible for the increase in groundwater discharge.},

abstract = {Hydrologic processes that are components of regional water balance occur on scales considerably smaller than the region itself. Evapotranspiration and percolation during interstorm periods are hydrologic processes whose rates depend on conditions that vary significantly in space due to soil and vegetation heterogeneity as well as moisture redistribution under topography. Infiltration and runoff during storm periods also vary significantly in space due to the spatial variability in surface moisture conditions. In time, these hydrologic processes are switching between climate-limited and soil-controlled regimes during both storm and interstorm periods. The space and time dependence inherent in these components of water balance limit the applicability of lumped or averaged models. These simplified models appear in hydrologic applications whose objectives are to estimate regional water balance. They are also present in the hydrologic parametrization of atmospheric models. In this paper an analytical model of soil-water balance that is distributed in space and time is developed. In order to retain analytical tractability, it is assumed that the space-time variability is statistically homogeneous and isotropic. The surface hydrology is forced with a stochastic model of rainfall that phenomenologically captures the arrival of intense precipitating cells within clusters that are imbedded in squall lines and rainbands. An analysis of the spatial and temporal fluctuations in both the rainfields and soil moisture fields are made in frequency-domain. The effects of averaging operations on these fields are delineated and the consequences for hydrologic and atmospheric models that use lumped water balance expressions are quantified. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Mountainous headwaters include a variety of spatial landscape units; however, the flow contribution from different hydrologic components is complex and often unclear. In addition to complex landscape controls, temporal meteorological drivers play an important role in the distribution between surface runoff and subsurface storage changes. This spatiotemporal variability in partitioning can influence catchment-wide flow accumulation and nutrient and sediment loading. We use a multi-year, multi-method analysis of stable isotopes, geochemical indicators, and discharge distributed throughout the Haean catchment in South Korea to identify temporal variability in hydrologic flow partitioning from surface runoff, springs, shallow interflow, and groundwater under monsoonal conditions. By combining a weighted, multi-method discharge approach, high frequency, synoptic, catchment-wide isotopic and geochemical sampling, and baseflow analysis, we characterize watershed-scale spatiotemporal hydrologic flow partitioning. Meteorological drivers are spatially variable throughout the catchment and temporally between individual events. Baseflow contributions in the high elevation, forested areas are up to 50{\%}, while the majority of the catchment is approximately 20{\%}. Our study builds on previously reported seasonality of isotopic signatures by quantifying trends in distributed event-based partitioning of isotopic tracers. We demonstrate that high frequency flow partitioning can accurately be determined in mountainous topography with high precipitation and that there is a need for multiple method characterizations. Our results further show the benefit of spatially distributed synoptic sampling for process understanding of hydrologic partitioning throughout the watersheds.},

abstract = {Transfer of atmospheric N deposition on shallow-soil forested basins on the Canadian Shield to receiving water bodies may be enhanced by rapid preferential dow along the soil-bedrock interface (BR runoff) on basin slopes. Controls on BR runoff, partitioning of event and pre-event water contributions to this how, and implications of this partitioning for N fluxes in BR runoff were studied under natural and artificial inputs to an instrumented slope. BR runoff as a fraction of water inputs to the slope increased with antecedent soil wetness and input depth. Event water contributions to BR runoff initially increased with antecedent soil wetness, but then declined at large antecedent soil wetness, Export of applied NH4+ from the slope was maximized when event water contributions containing large NH4+ concentrations dominated BR runoff; however, there was no relationship between the fraction of NO3- application transported in BR runoff and either application input or the event mater fraction of that runoff. The applicability of our results to other shallow-soil areas of the Canadian Shield is limited by artificial N inputs to the slope in excess of natural loads and by low rates of N mineralization and negligible nitrification in the slope's soils. Nevertheless, the study reinforces the need to consider how the hydrologic, geometric and pedologic properties of forest slopes interact with biotic and abiotic soil processes to control N transport and transformation.

abstract = {Geo-spatial interpolation methods are often necessary in instances where the precipitation estimates available frommultisensor source data on a specific spatial grid need to be transformed to another grid with a different spatial grid or orientation. The study involves development and evaluation of spatial interpolation or weighting methods for transforming hourly multisensor precipitation estimates (MPE) available in the form of 44km2 HRAP (hydrologic rainfall analysis project) grid to a Cartesian 22km2 radar (NEXt generation RADar:NEXRAD) grid. Six spatial interpolation weighting methods are developed and evaluated to assess their suitability for transformation of precipitation estimates in space and time. The methods use distances and areal extents of intersection segments of the grids as weights in the interpolation schemes. These methods were applied to transform precipitation estimates from HRAP to NEXRAD grids in the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) region in South Florida, United States. A total of 192 rain gauges are used as ground truth to assess the quality of precipitation estimates obtained from these interpolation methods. The rain gauge data in the SFWMD region were also used for radar data bias correction procedures. To help in the assessment, several error measures are calculated and appropriate weighting functions are developed to select the most accurate method for the transformation. Three local interpolation methods out of six methods were found to be competitive and inverse distance based on four nearest neighbors (grids) was found to be the best for the transformation of data.},

abstract = {Subsurface stormflow is an important component of the rainfall-runoff response, especially in steep terrain. Its contribution to total runoff is, however, poorly represented in the current generation of land surface models. The lack of physical basis of these common parameterizations precludes a priori estimation of the stormflow (i.e. without calibration), which is a major drawback for prediction in ungauged basins, or for use in global land surface models. This paper is aimed at deriving regionalized parameterizations of the storage-discharge relationship relating to subsurface stormflow from a top-down empirical data analysis of streamflow recession curves extracted from 50 eastern United States catchments. Detailed regression analyses were performed between parameters of the empirical storage-discharge relationships and the controlling climate, soil and topographic characteristics. The regression analyses performed on empirical recession curves at catchment scale indicated that the coefficient of the power-law form storage-discharge relationship is closely related to the catchment hydrologic characteristics, which is consistent with the hydraulic theory derived mainly at the hillslope scale. As for the exponent, besides the role of field scale soil hydraulic properties as suggested by hydraulic theory, it is found to be more strongly affected by climate (aridity) at the catchment scale. At a fundamental level these results point to the need for more detailed exploration of the co-dependence of soil, vegetation and topography with climate.},

abstract = {It is generally acknowledged that in order to apply radar rainfall data for hydrological proposes adjustment against ground observations are crucial. Traditionally, radar reflectivity is transformed into rainfall rates applying a fixed reflectivity - rainfall rate relationship even though this is known to depend on the changing drop size distribution of the specific rain. This creates a transient bias between the radar rainfall and the ground observations due to seasonal changes of the drop size distribution as well as other atmospheric effects and effects related to the radar observational technology. In this study different bias adjustment techniques is investigated, developing a complete 10-year dataset (2002-2012) of high spatio-temporal resolution radar rainfall based on a radar observations from a single C-band radar from Denmark. Results show that hourly adjustment mean field bias adjustment outperform daily mean field bias adjustment with regards to estimation of rainfall totals and peak rain rates. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that radar rainfall estimates can be improved significantly by implementation of a novel advection interpolation technique. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {A hydrological forecasting model is presented that attempts to combine the important distributed effects of channel network topology and dynamic contributing areas with the advantages of simple lumped parameter basin models. Quick response flow is predicted from a storage/con- tributing area relationship derived analytically from the topographic structure of a unit within a basin. Average soil water response is represented by a constant leakage infiltration store and an exponential subsurface water store. A simple non-linear routing procedure related to the link frequency distribution of the channel network completes the model and allows distinct basin sub-units, such as headwater and sideslope areas to be modelled separately. The model parameters are physically based in the sense that they may be determined directly by measurement and the model may be used at ungauged sites. Procedures for applying the model and tests with data from the Crimple Beck basin are described. Using only measured and estimated parameter values, with- out optimization, the model makes satisfactory predictions of basin response. The modular form of the model structure should allow application over a range of small and medium sized basins while retaining the possibility of including more complex model components when suitable data are available.},

abstract = {This study presents an exhaustive methodology of floodplain mapping at ungauged rivers. To present our methodology, we selected the Halilrud basin and Jiroft city in southeastern Iran as an example of hazardous regions. To estimate flood quantiles in different return periods at ungauged reaches, we used regional flood frequency analysis. By using the well-known L-moments approach and related criteria, a homogeneous region was formed and the 3-parameter Log normal distribution was identified as the robust regional frequency distribution. The hydro-geomorphic characteristics and the land use properties of the catchments were then extracted using RS{\&}GIS techniques to establish multivariate regional regression models between hydro-geomorphic characteristics and flood quantiles. After delineation of the catchments for the ungauged reaches, flood quantiles as an important factor in flood inundation at outlets of these reaches with different probabilities were estimated using the regional regression models. To delineate flood hazard maps and to enhance the accuracy of the hydraulic modeling, we applied satellite stereoscope images of Cartosat-1 along with the Rational Polynomial Coefficients to extract a high resolution DTM and detailed parameterization of the channel required by 1D hydraulic model HEC-RAS. The GIS-based HEC-Geo RAS pre- and post-processor were also used for careful optimization of the geometry features for real visualization of the flood prone areas. Information of some historical flood events was also used to evaluate the hydraulic model performance in predicting flood inundations. Finally, vulnerable areas were crossed with extracted land use mapping from IRS-P6 satellite images to differentiate the critical infrastructures and the valuable land use classes affected by floods in different return periods. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and revised USLE (RUSLE) are often used to estimate soil erosion at regional landscape scales, however a major limitation is the difficulty in extracting the LS factor. The geographic information system-based (GIS-based) methods which have been developed for estimating the LS factor for USLE and RUSLE also have limitations. The unit contributing area-based estimation method (UCA) converts slope length to unit contributing area for considering two-dimensional topography, however is not able to predict the different zones of soil erosion and deposition. The flowpath and cumulative cell length-based method (FCL) overcomes this disadvantage but does not consider channel networks and flow convergence in two-dimensional topography. The purpose of this research was to overcome these limitations and extend the FCL method through inclusion of channel networks and convergence flow. We developed LS-TOOL in Microsoft's.NET environment using C{\#} with a user-friendly interface. Comparing the LS factor calculated with the three methodologies (UCA, FCL and LS-TOOL), LS-TOOL delivers encouraging results. In particular, LS-TOOL uses breaks in slope identified from the DEM to locate soil erosion and deposition zones, channel networks and convergence flow areas. Comparing slope length and LS factor values generated using LS-TOOL with manual methods, LS-TOOL corresponds more closely with the reality of the Xiannangou catchment than results using UCA or FCL. The LS-TOOL algorithm can automatically calculate slope length, slope steepness, L factor, S factor, and LS factors, providing the results as ASCII files which can be easily used in some GIS software. This study is an important step forward in conducting more accurate large area erosion evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Channel types found in mountain drainages occupy characteristic but intergrading ranges of bed slope that reflect a dynamic balance between erosive energy and channel boundary resistance. Using a classification and regression tree (CART) modeling approach, we demonstrate that drainage area scaling of channel slopes provides better discrimination of these forms than slope alone among supply- and capacity-limited sites. Analysis of 270 stream reaches in the western United States exhibiting four common mountain channel types reveals that these types exist within relatively discrete ranges of an index of specific stream power. We also demonstrate associations among regional interannual precipitation variability, discharge distribution skewness, and means of the specific stream power index of step-pool channels. Finally, we discuss a conceptual methodology for predicting ecologically relevant morphologic units from digital elevation models at the network scale based on the finding that channel types do not exhibit equal energy dissipation.},

abstract = {The topic of this paper is temporal interpolation of precipitation observed by weather radars. Precipitation measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution are, in general, desired for urban drainage applications. An advection-based interpolation method is developed which uses methods for vector field estimation already known from short-term weather radar nowcasting. However, instead of forecasting the weather radar rainfall, the proposed interpolation method exploits the advection of the rainfall in the interpolation. The interpolated rainfall fields are validated by measurements at ground level from laser disdrometers. The proposed interpolation method performs better when compared to traditional interpolation of weather radar rainfall where the radar observation is considered constant in time between measurements. It is demonstrated that the advection-based interpolation method reconstructs a significant part of the temporal variations of the rainfall. Moreover, the interpolated precipitation fields estimate accumulated rain depths more accurately. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Landslides are a main cause of human and economic losses worldwide. For this reason, landslide hazard assessment and the capacity to predict this phenomenon have been topics of great interest within the scientific community for the implementation of early warning systems. Although several models have been proposed to forecast shallow landslides triggered by rainfall, few models have incorporated geotechnical factors into a complete hydrological model of a basin that can simulate the storage and movement of rainwater through the soil profile. These basin and full hydrological models have adopted a physically based approach. This paper develops a conceptual and physically based model called open and distributed hydrological simulation and landslides—SHIA{\_}Landslide (Simulaci{\'{o}}n HIdrol{\'{o}}gica Abierta, or SHIA, in Spanish)—that is supported by geotechnical and hydrological features occurring on a basin-wide scale in tropical and mountainous terrains. SHIA{\_}Landslide is an original and significant contribution that offers a new perspective with which to analyse shallow landslide processes by incorporating a comprehensive distributed hydrological tank model that includes water storage in the soil coupled with a classical analysis of infinite slope stability under saturated conditions. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be distinguished by the following: (i) its capacity to capture surface topography and effects concerning the subsurface flow; (ii) its use of digital terrain model (DTM) to establish the relationships among cells, geomorphological parameters, slope angle, direction, etc.; (iii) its continuous simulation of rainfall data over long periods and event simulations of specific storms; (iv) its consideration of the effects of horizontal and vertical flow; and (vi) its inclusion of a hydrologically complete water process that allows for hydrological calibration. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be combined with real-time rainfall data and implemented in early warning systems.},

abstract = {Baseflow is often regarded as the streamflow component derived predominantly from groundwater discharge. The estimation of baseflow is important for water supply, water allocation, investigation of contamination impacts, low flow hydrology and flood hydrology. Baseflow is commonly estimated using graphical methods, recursive digital filters (RDFs), tracer based methods, and conceptual models. Of all of these methods, RDFs are the most commonly used, due to their relatively easy and efficient implementation. This paper presents a generic framework for assessing and improving the performance of RDFs for baseflow estimation for catchments with different characteristics and subject to different hydrological conditions. As part of the framework, a fully integrated surface water/groundwater (SW/GW) model is used to obtain estimates of streamflow and baseflow for catchments with different properties, such as soil types and rainfall patterns. An RDF is then applied to the simulated streamflow to assess how well the baseflow obtained using the filter matches the baseflow obtained using the fully integrated SW/GW model. In order to improve the performance of the filter, the user-defined parameter(s) controlling filter operation can be adjusted in order to obtain the best match between the baseflow obtained using the filter and that obtained using the fully integrated SW/GW model (i.e. through calibration). The proposed framework is tested by applying it to a common SW/GW benchmarking problem, the tilted V-catchment, for a range of soil properties. HydroGeoSphere (HGS) is used to develop the fully integrated SW/GW model and the Lyne and Hollick (LH) filter is used as the RDF. The performance of the LH filter is assessed using the commonly used value of the filter parameter of 0.925, as well as calibrated filter parameter values. The results obtained show that the performance of the LH filter is affected significantly by the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of the soil and that calibrated LH filter parameter can result in significant improvements in filter performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We also performed a rain-on-snow experiment where we sampled leachate from a melting snow core continuously at 2 min intervals for 5 h. These data show remarkable fine-scale patterns of internal rain-snow mixing, patterns that would not have been detected without such high-frequency sampling.

abstract = {Base flow is an important component in hydrological modeling. This process is usually modeled by using the linear aquifer storage-discharge relation approach, although the outflow from groundwater aquifers is nonlinear. To identify the accuracy of base flow estimates in rivers dominated by snowmelt and/or glacier melt in arid and cold northwestern China, a nonlinear storage-discharge relationship for use in SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) modeling was developed and applied to the Manas River basin in the Tian Shan Mountains. Linear reservoir models and a digital filter program were used for comparisons. Meanwhile, numerical analysis of recession curves from 78 river gauge stations revealed variation in the parameters of the nonlinear relationship. It was found that the nonlinear reservoir model can improve the streamflow simulation, especially for low-flow period. The higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, logarithmic efficiency, and volumetric efficiency, and lower percent bias were obtained when compared to the one-linear reservoir approach. The parameter {\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}/i{\textgreater} of the aquifer storage-discharge function varied mostly between 0.0 and 0.1, which is much smaller than the suggested value of 0.5. The coefficient {\textless}i{\textgreater}a{\textless}/i{\textgreater} of the function is related to catchment properties, primarily the basin and glacier areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Application of weather radar data in urban hydrological applications has evolved significantly during the past decade as an alternative to traditional rainfall observations with rain gauges. Advances in radar hardware, data processing, numerical models, and emerging fields within urban hydrology necessitate an updated review of the state of the art in such radar rainfall data and applications. Three key areas with significant advances over the past decade have been identified: (1) temporal and spatial resolution of rainfall data required for different types of hydrological applications, (2) rainfall estimation, radar data adjustment and data quality, and (3) nowcasting of radar rainfall and real-time applications. Based on these three fields of research, the paper provides recommendations based on an updated overview of shortcomings, gains, and novel developments in relation to urban hydrological applications. The paper also reviews how the focus in urban hydrology research has shifted over the last decade to fields such as climate change impacts, resilience of urban areas to hydrological extremes, and online prediction/warning systems. It is discussed how radar rainfall data can add value to the aforementioned emerging fields in current and future applications, but also to the analysis of integrated water systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal variation underlies and complicates studies related to earth surface processes. Subsequent to our previous studies reporting the temporal invariability of sediment concentration, this study further reports the spatial invariability of sediment concentration or the flow-sediment relationship in the hilly part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The dense channel network dissects this area into numerous sub-watersheds, which are composed of entire slopes (a combination of the hill slope and the valley side slope). Our data mainly involves ten experimental sites of entire slope and sub-watershed and 580 flood events at three locations. Our analysis at the intra-event time scale shows that the instantaneous sediment concentrations in runoff can generally approach the detach-limited maximum sediment concentration since the active massing wasting ensures an abundant sediment supply. Consequently, the event mean sediment concentration does not only remain fairly constant among flow events but also among the experimental sites despite the possible differences in topography, soil management or land cover, water source, soil surface properties, etc. This observation also holds at the annual time scale. Our result implies that a single proportional function is adequate to fit the flow-sediment relationship for any entire slope or sub-watershed, where eroded sediments are primarily sourced, over a considerable areal extent unless soil property has changed or check dams are installed. Moreover, the proportionality coefficient, which is indicative of the maximum detachment capacity, can be approximated through flume experiments rather than necessarily through long-term field observations. Our finding can facilitate the obtainment of spatially distributed information on soil loss in the Chinese Loess Plateau and is also indicative of other locations where sediment supply is sufficiently available. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding and modelling the relationship between rainfall and runoff has been a driving force in hydrology for many years. Baseflow separation and recession analysis have been two of the main tools for understanding runoff generation in catchments, but there are many different methods for each and no consensus on how best to apply them. A new baseflow separation method is presented, which is justified by being based generally on the more objective tracer separation methods and by being optimised by fitting to the recession hydrograph. Using this baseflow separation method, the thesis is advanced that recession analysis should be applied to the separated components (quickflow and baseflow), because of their very different origins and characteristics, rather than to the streamflow itself because analysing the latter alone gives misleading results. Applying baseflow separation before recession analysis sheds new light on water storage in catchments and may resolve some current prob- lems with recession analysis. It may also have implications for rainfall–runoff modelling. Among other things it shows that both quickflow and baseflow reservoirs have non- linear (quadratic) characteristics in the studied catchment (Glendhu, New Zealand).},

abstract = {Precipitation is often the most important input data in hydrological models when simulating streamflow. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a widely used hydrological model, only makes use of data from one precipitation gauge station that is nearest to the centroid of each subbasin, which is eventually corrected using the elevation band method. This leads in general to inaccurate representation of subbasin precipitation input data, particularly in catchments with complex topography. To investigate the impact of different precipitation inputs on the SWAT model simulations in Alpine catchments, 13??years (1998???2010) of daily precipitation data from four datasets including OP (Observed precipitation), IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting data), CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) and TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) has been considered. Both model performances (comparing simulated and measured streamflow data at the catchment outlet) as well as parameter and prediction uncertainties have been quantified. For all three subbasins, the use of elevation bands is fundamental to match the water budget. Streamflow predictions obtained using IDW inputs are better than those obtained using the other datasets in terms of both model performance and prediction uncertainty. Models using the CHIRPS product as input provide satisfactory streamflow estimation, suggesting that this satellite product can be applied to this data-scarce Alpine region. Comparing the performance of SWAT models using different precipitation datasets is therefore important in data-scarce regions. This study has shown that, precipitation is the main source of uncertainty, and different precipitation datasets in SWAT models lead to different best estimate ranges for the calibrated parameters. This has important implications for the interpretation of the simulated hydrological processes.},

In the past, different formulations of the most simple filter type, the so-called one-parameter filter, have been proposed. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed for filter algorithms that were constructed under the assumption that the outflow from an aquifer is linearly proportional to its storage. It is shown that these one-parameter filters describing an exponential baseflow recession are all special cases of a two-parameter filter whose equation is specified. Its parameters are the recession constant—which can be objectively determined by a recession analysis—and BFImax, the maximum value of the baseflow index that can be modelled by the algorithm. This introduces a subjective element into the baseflow calculation, since BFImax is not measurable. A preliminary analysis based on the results of conventional separation techniques shows that it might be possible to find typical BFImax values for classes of catchments that can be unequivocally distinguished by their hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the use of a two-component hydrograph separation model to predict the leaching of two relatively soluble herbicides, isoproturon and simazine, from an agricultural drained clay soil. The model successfully predicted the pattern and extent of herbicide leaching in drainflow at a 15-min time interval using electrical conductivity of rainfall and drainflow as the single chemical parameter. Analysis of the hydrological characteristics of individual rainfall events allowed current sources of uncertainty in the model to be identified and highlighted areas for further research. For example, future use of the model should incorporate the measurement of intra-event variations in electrical conductivity of rainfall as an input in order to improve model accuracy and precision. Repeated under-estimation of herbicide concentration in drainflow when suspended sediment concentrations were elevated indicated that desorption hysteresis may have occurred at the soil surface and during transport through the tile drain system. This resulted in the transport of a greater proportion of herbicide through preferential pathways in sediment-associated form than predicted by assuming an instantaneous desorption at the soil surface. The results of the research suggest that the nature and importance of sediment-associated herbicide transport through tile drains warrants further investigation. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Many shallow landslides are triggered by heavy rainfall. Previous studies of landslide modeling have been hampered by the scarcity of rain gauges to adequately depict the spatial variability of rainfall conditions triggering landslides. This study simulates the efficiency of the critical rainfall model for landslide prediction in a mountainous watershed with inputs of different rainfall estimates associated with a typhoon (tropical cyclone) event. Doppler radar data at a spatial resolution of 1??km and measurements from six gauging stations provide the sources for rainfall estimates. Inverse distance weighted, splines, and kriging are the interpolation methods for gauged rainfall estimates. A comparison of the simulation outputs shows that the model using radar rainfall estimates has a better performance than those using gauged rainfall estimates in predicting both landslides and stable areas. In light of the results, this paper also discusses the validity of the critical rainfall model for landslides in relation to its rainfall input and steady-state hydrological assumption. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/hyp.3360090206.abs C. H. TAYLOR Methodological issues associated with isotopic hydrograph separations (IHSs) in built-up environments are explored using results from the 1990 spring melt in a suburban basin in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The hetrogeneous nature of suburban environments complicates the selection of appropriate isotopic signatures for event and pre-event waters. Near-stream groundwater $\delta$18O sampled from wells was poorly mixed, such that the pre-event water signature was best characterized by $\delta$18O in pre-melt baseflow or discharge from a headwater spring. The event water signature during snowmelt can be characterized using $\delta$18O in the pre-melt snowpack, surface runoff samples or meltwater from lysimeters. However, the use of snowpack $\delta$18O may be inappropriate in suburban basins where meltwater from thin snowcover may exhibit pronounced responses to $\delta$18O in rainfall contributions. Intensive sampling of the spatial variability of runoff or meltwater $\delta$18O may be required to characterize the average event water signature adequately. Rainfall $\delta$18O provided an appropriate event water signal during a large rain on snow event, and differences between this IHS and one generated using an event water signature that included meltwater contributions from snow-covered surfaces were within the uncertainty attributable to the analytical error in $\delta$18O values. Event water supplied 55-63{\%} of the peak discharge and 48-58{\%} of total runoff from the basin during the melt, which is consistent with the fraction of the basin that has been developed. These results contrast with IHSs conducted in forested basins that suggest that stormflow is dominated by pre-event water contributions.},

abstract = {Different hydraulic parameters, including the hydraulic shear stress, unit length shear force, steam power, unit steam power, and effective stream power were used to quantify flow detachment. Most former studies were conducted for flow detachment under uniform slope surface conditions, while a few studies compared different slope surface conditions. The uniform bare loess was prepared in laboratory experiments. Natural fallowed soil loess with stone covers was prepared in field experiments. The objective of this study was to assess the differences in hydraulic parameters and sediment detachment under these different soil surface conditions. Our results show that the unit sediment load (Rs) has a good linear relationship with the unit runoff rate (Rr) for the flume and field experiments, and the relationship can be expressed as the function: Rs=0.262Rr-0.802 (R2=0.947). The rate of Manning roughness coefficient to mean flow depth (n/h) is a good hydraulic indicator like as the stream power and Reynolds number for predicting the sediment load. Hydraulic parameters n/h, Re, and ?? are good indicators for the unit area sediment load for both the flume and field experiments, while Fr, f, and ?? are good indicators for the unit area sediment load only when the flume experiments and field experiments are individually analyzed. Among the three good indicators (??, Re, and n/h), n/h is better than the other two for predicting sediment load in rill erosion for both flume and field experiments, as well as for the unit solute transport rate (MBr). The parameter of n/h probably is not only a good hydraulic parameter as an indicator for both sediment and solute transport, but also a good hydraulic parameter which link with runoff energies. The parameter n/h represents the flow wave of runoff and is an important factor to represent the energy for water and sediment transport, and the flow wave celerity (vw) is related to n/h by: vw=1.585(n/h)-0.527 (R2=0.978). ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A grid-based flow routing and runoff-production model, configured to employ as input either observed or Regional Climate Model (RCM) estimates of precipitation and potential evaporation (PE), has previously been used to assess how climate change may impact river flows across the UK. The slope-based Grid-to-Grid (G2G) model adequately simulated observed river flows under current climate conditions for high relief catchments, but was less successful when applied to lower-relief and/or groundwater-dominated areas. The model has now been enhanced to employ a soil dataset to configure the probability-distributed store controlling soil-moisture and runoff generation within each grid-cell. A comparison is made of the ability of both models to simulate gauged river flows across a range of British catchments using observations of rainfall and PE as input. Superior performance from the enhanced G2G formulation incorporating the soil dataset is demonstrated. Following the model assessment, the observed precipitation and PE data used as input to both hydrological models were replaced by RCM estimates on a 25 km grid for a Current (1961-1990) and a Future (2071-2100) time-slice. Flood frequency curves derived from the flow simulations for the two time-slices are used to estimate, for the first time, maps of changes in flood magnitude for all river points on a 1 km grid across the UK. A high degree of spatial variability is seen in the estimated change in river flows, reflecting both projected climate change and the influences of landscape and climate variability. These maps also highlight large differences between the climate impact projections arising from the two models. The improved structure and performance of the soil-based G2G model adds confidence to its projections of flow changes being realistic consequences of the climate change scenario applied. A resampling method is used to identify regions where these projections may be considered robust. However, with the climate change scenario used representing only one plausible evolution of the future climate, no clear message can be drawn here about projected river flow changes.

abstract = {The surface or near-surface soil moisture at the interface between atmospheric and terrestrial environments has significant implications for the complex interactions between hydrological processes and ecosystems. Although a number of previous studies have reported the spatial patterns and structures of surface moisture in pasture environments based on large sample sizes, information regarding the detailed spatial patterns and structure of surface moisture in a natural forest environment is still sparse, particularly for steep headwater catchments due to the labor intensity involved and the difficulty of making field measurements. In this study, we measured the detailed surface soil water content at depths of 0-12cm and 0-20cm at 470 measurement points using the TDR (time domain reflectometry) method. Thirteen surveys were conducted within 1year in a steep natural forested headwater catchment with a subtropical monsoon climate in Taiwan. The sample and model variograms were used to evaluate the spatial structure of the surface soil moisture. We also compared the spatial structures of surface moisture in this study with those in a similar study conducted in a flat pasture catchment (Western et al., 1998). For the results at our site, exponential model variograms with the nugget effect well fitted sample variograms, indicating an obvious regional dependence of surface moisture and stationary spatial structures in all surveys. The geostatistical structural characteristics of the nugget varied between 22.70 and 47.40 ({\%} V/V)2; the sill varied between 54.99 and 98.51 ({\%} V/V)2; and the range varied between 10.20 and 58.65m. The nugget, sill, and range all increased with an increase in soil moisture. The notable anisotropy under dry conditions was attributed to the year-round surface runoff pathway. The sample variograms that represented the spatial structure of soil moisture and reliably estimated the nugget, sill, and range required a sample size of at least 235 at our 0.15-ha site (i.e., a measurement resolution of at least 6.4m2 per sample). The pattern of soil moisture was relatively stationary in two gullies and on the side of a hillslope, but it varied on the valley-head hillslope depending on whether conditions were dry or wet. In contrast to previous results for a flat pasture catchment (Western et al., 1998), our results produced a right-skewed histogram of soil moisture under dry or moderately wet conditions, variograms that tended to increase with an increase in soil moisture, anisotropy of soil moisture structure under dry, but not wet, conditions, a need for a 55 times higher measurement resolution associated with the large sample size, and a larger nugget effect in the steep natural forested headwater catchment. This study identified the spatial structure and patterns of surface soil moisture as the primary step in understanding hydrologic processes in a natural forested headwater catchment.},

abstract = {The long-term temporal evolution of soil thickness in hollows depends on the processes controlling the rates of colluvium accumulation and erosion. Accumulation is due to soil creep and mass-wasting processes from the adjacent slopes, while erosion of colluvial deposits is mainly due to debris flow and landsliding. An analysis of the long-term evolution of colluvial deposits is developed through a stochastic model of soil mass balance at a point accounting for colluvium infilling, expressed as a deterministic function of the deposit thickness, and soil erosion by shallow landslides, modeled as a random (Poisson) process. Landsliding is related to the characteristics of the triggering precipitation through an infinite-slope stability analysis, a kinematic model of hollow response to rainfall, and the intensity-duration-frequency curves characterizing the regime of extreme precipitation. This analysis provides a probabilistic representation of the long-term dynamics at a point of colluvium thickness as a function of the timescale of hollow infilling and of the frequency of triggering rainfalls. The model is solved both numerically and (under simplified conditions) analytically, showing the existence of different regimes in the temporal evolution of soil thickness. In the case of steep slopes (i.e., with slope angles, $\beta$, greater than the soil repose angle, ϕ) the hollow can be either in a supply-limited state or in event-limited conditions, depending on whether the dynamics are limited by the supply of sediment from the adjacent slopes or by the occurrence of rainstorms able to trigger landslides. Nevertheless, since the likelihood of landslide occurrence increases with increasing values of deposit thickness, colluvium accretion always leads to conditions favorable to landsliding. Vice versa, in the case of gentle slopes (i.e., $\beta$ {\textless} ϕ) the probability of landsliding decreases with increasing values of soil thickness, and event-limited conditions may evolve into unconditionally stable states.},

They are easy-to-use, simple-to-design, and capable of targeting multiple loci simultaneously. Given that cancer develops from cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations, CRISPR-Cas9 and its variants (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-Cas9 systems) hold extensive application potentials in cancer modeling and therapy. To date, they have already been applied to model oncogenic mutations in cell lines1 and in adult animals2 , as well as to combat cancer by disabling oncogenic viruses3 or by manipulating cancer genome4 . Given the importance of epigenome and transcriptome in tumorigenesis, manipulation of cancer epigenome and transcriptome for cancer modeling and therapy is a promising area in the future. Whereas (epi)genetic modifications of cancer microenvironment with CRISPR-Cas9 systems for therapeutic purposes represent another promising area in cancer research. Herein, we introduce the functions and mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in genome editing and epigenome modulation, retrospect their applications in cancer modelling and therapy, discuss limitations and possible solutions, and propose future directions, in hope of providing concise and enlightening information for readers interested in this area.

abstract = {This work aims to evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of radar rainfall estimates for the identification of debris flow occurrence rainfall thresholds. Observations from a C-band weather radar and raingauge data are analyzed for seven convective rainfall events that triggered 117 debris flows in the Upper Adige river basin (Eastern Italian Alps). Four radar rainfall scenarios characterized by incrementally increasing accuracy are used for the estimation of rainfall intensity-duration thresholds. Error sources considered in the radar correction chain include beam blockage, attenuation and vertical profile of reflectivity. The impact of rainfall accuracy on the estimation of the intensity-duration thresholds is analyzed by comparing the thresholds derived from the various radar rainfall scenarios, using the rainfall estimates obtained from the application of the complete correction algorithm as a reference scenario. Results show that the application of the complete correction algorithm improves significantly the accuracy of radar rainfall estimates: Fractional Standard Error is decreased by 20{\%}, Correlation Coefficient is increased by 24{\%} relative to uncorrected data. Correction for atmospheric attenuation is the most important step in the correction chain. The use of uncorrected radar estimates leads to substantially underestimated thresholds with respect to the reference scenario; adjusting radar data for bias is not sufficient to overcome this problem. Radar rainfall estimates which are corrected but not adjusted with raingauge data are able to provide intensity-duration thresholds which are almost indistinguishable from the reference scenario. The derivation of the radar-based threshold is shown to be very sensitive to spatial location errors of rainfall and debris flows. Raingauge-based thresholds are severely underestimated with respect to the reference scenario. This clearly demonstrates the severity of the raingauge-based estimation problem for the derivation of debris flow triggering rainfall and highlights the benefits of using weather radar observations, at least for the case of short duration convective storms.},

Numerous sources of these errors are due to parameter estimation, the observational system and measurement principles, and not fully understood physical processes. Propagation of these uncertainties through all models for which radarrainfall are used as input (e.g., hydrologic models) or as initial conditions (e.g., weather forecasting models) is necessary to enhance the understanding and interpretation of the obtained results. The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive literature review of the principal sources of error affecting single polarization radar-based rainfall estimates. These include radar miscalibration, attenuation, ground clutter and anomalous propagation, beam blockage, variability of the Z–R relation, range degradation, vertical variability of the precipitation system, vertical air motion and precipitation drift, and temporal sampling errors.

abstract = {Recent data analyses of a dozen or so large networks support the presence of simple scaling in the probability distributions of many topologic, geometric, and hydraulic- geometric variables. We have labeled them “generalized Horton laws” in contrast to traditional Horton laws which are stated only in terms of means. These data sets also show that Horton's bifurcation ratios are significantly larger than 4, which can not be predicted by the well-known random model. Motivated by the need to understand these data analyses of large river networks within a common theoretical framework, a new class of models with statistically self-similar network topology is introduced. The network construction process can be viewed as a statistical generalization of the type of a recursive process which generates many fractal geometrical objects. Unlike the well-known random model, our random channel networks do not belong to the class of binary Galton-Watson stochastic branching processes. The generalized Horton laws are predicted in the limit of large Horton-Strahler order as a scale parameter for a subclass of random self-similar network models. A derivation of Horton's law of stream numbers as a consequence of the simple scaling of distributions of basin magnitude gives it a new theoretical significance. A further subclass also exhibits Tokunga self-similarity, which is an average property of the side tributary structure in river networks. Comparisons with empirical observations for three large basins analyzed here show that the generalized Horton laws are well predicted by this new class of random self-similar network models, and analytically predicted relationships between topologic and geometric Horton ratios are also seen in data.},

Moreover, understanding of the runoff generation processes is essential for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes on the hydro logical response of a catchment. Many methods for base flow separation exist, but hardly one focuses on the specific behaviour of temperate lowland areas. This paper presents the results of a base flow separation study carried out in a lowland area in the Netherlands. In this study, field observations of precipitation, groundwater and surface water levels and discharges, together with tracer analysis are used to understand the runoff generation processes in the catchment. Several tracer and non-tracer based base flow separation methods were applied to the discharge time series, and their results are compared. The results show that groundwater levels react fast to precipitation events in this lowland area with shallow groundwater tables. Moreover, a good correlation was found between groundwater levels and discharges suggesting that most of the measured discharge also during floods comes from groundwater storage. It was estimated using tracer hydro logical approaches that approximately 90{\%} of the total discharge is groundwater displaced by event water mainly infiltrating in the northern part of the catchment, and only the remaining 10{\%} is surface runoff. The impact of remote recharge causing displacement of near channel ground water during floods could also be motivated with hydraulic approximations. The results show further that when base flow separation is meant to identify groundwater contributions to stream flow, process based methods (e.g. the rating curve method; Kliner and Knezek, 1974) are more reliable than other simple non-tracer based methods. Also, the recursive filtering method (proposed by Eckhardt, 2005) can be calibrated well using the results of tracer investigation giving good results. Consequently, non-tracer based base flow separation methods that can be validated for some events may provide a powerful tool for groundwater assessment or model calibration/validation in lowland areas. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2009.},

abstract = {Digital filters are useful tools for assessing the contribution of groundwater to total river flow. Several of those filters have been proposed in the last decades. One of the last contributions on this subject was given by Ekchardt (2005) who proposed a more general form of a digital baseflow filter and showed that some of the most used filters are special cases of this general form. This new filter has the inconvenience of having two parameters, one of them may be obtained directly from recession analysis, but the other (maximum baseflow index (BFImax)) is routinely estimated by a priori defined values according to the predominant geological characteristics of the drainage basin. In this short communication, we propose a method to estimate BFImax by a backwards filtering operation. The method was applied using data from 15 gauging stations in Brazil, with a varied range of groundwater contribution to streamflow. Results of the new estimation method for the BFImax parameter are coherent with the values which would be adopted by considering geological characteristics of the river basins.},

The Rio Conchos provides approximately 55{\%} of the water deliveries to the United States under the 1944 water treaty signed between both countries. The hydrologic modeling has been developed using the one-dimensional, two-layer soil moisture accounting scheme embedded in the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model. A 10-year period was used to calibrate the model, which was achieved by a trial-and-error method for the adjustment of the model parameters. The results show a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.84 at Ojinaga station (mouth of the basin) and 0.81 at La Boquilla, indicating good model performance. In general the model predicts well the monthly, annual, and maximum flows; but there are significant differences between the model values and undeveloped (naturalized) flows for low flow periods, especially at La Boquilla station.

The ERS Scatterometer is a C-band radar with a spatial resolution of 50 km and a high temporal sampling rate. An algorithm for estimating the surface soil moisture content is applied to 6 years of data. A qualitative comparison with meteorological observations and auxiliary information indicates that good-quality surface wetness values can be determined. A simple method is developed to relate the surface estimates with the profile soil moisture content. This model requires as input the remotely sensed radar data and soil data encompassing wilting level, field capacity, and porosity. The method was validated with an extensive data set of gravimetric soil moisture measurements in the 0-20 cm and 0-100 cm layers from the agrometeorological network in the Ukraine. It is found that the ERS Scatterometer data can be used to distinguish about five soil moisture levels with good confidence.},

abstract = {Daily streamflow information is critical for solving various hydrologic problems, though observations of continuous streamflow for model calibration are available at only a small fraction of the world's rivers. One approach to estimate daily streamflow at an ungauged location is to transfer rainfall-runoff model parameters calibrated at a gauged (donor) catchment to an ungauged (receiver) catchment of interest. Central to this approach is the selection of a hydrologically similar donor. No single metric or set of metrics of hydrologic similarity have been demonstrated to consistently select a suitable donor catchment. We design an experiment to diagnose the dominant controls on successful hydrologic model parameter transfer. We calibrate a lumped rainfall-runoff model to 83 stream gauges across the United States. All locations are USGS reference gauges with minimal human influence. Parameter sets from the calibrated models are then transferred to each of the other catchments and the performance of the transferred parameters is assessed. This transfer experiment is carried out both at the scale of the entire US and then for six geographic regions. We use classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to determine the relationship between catchment similarity and performance of transferred parameters. Similarity is defined using physical/climatic catchment characteristics, as well as streamflow response characteristics (signatures such as baseflow index and runoff ratio). Across the entire US, successful parameter transfer is governed by similarity in elevation and climate, and high similarity in streamflow signatures. Controls vary for different geographic regions though. Geology followed by drainage, topography and climate constitute the dominant similarity metrics in forested eastern mountains and plateaus, whereas agricultural land use relates most strongly with successful parameter transfer in the humid plains.},

The initial satellite precipitation data comparisons show that the reanalyzed 3B42V6, with a bias of -4.54{\%}, matched best with the rain gauge observations, while the two near real-time satellite datasets (3B42RT and CMORPH) largely underestimated precipitation by 42.72{\%} and 40.81{\%} respectively. With the model parameters first benchmarked by the rain gauge data, the behavior of the streamflow simulation from the 3B42V6 was also the most optimal amongst the three products, while the two near real-time satellite datasets produced deteriorated biases and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSCEs). Still, when the model parameters were recalibrated by each individual satellite data, the performance of the streamflow simulations from the two near real-time satellite products were significantly improved, thus demonstrating the need for specific calibrations of the hydrological models for the near real-time satellite inputs. Moreover, when optimally merged with respect to the streamflows forced by the two near real-time satellite precipitation products and all the three satellite precipitation products using the Bayesian model averaging method, the resulted streamflow series further improved and became more robust. In summary, the three current state-of-the-art satellite precipitation products have demonstrated potential in hydrological research and applications. The benchmarking, recalibration, and optimal merging schemes for streamflow simulation at a basin scale described in the present work will hopefully be a reference for future utilizations of satellite precipitation products in global and regional hydrological applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The significant characteristics controlling the variability in storm-generated suspended-sediment loads and concentrations were analyzed for four basins of differing land use (forest, pasture, cropland, and urbanizing) in humid-tropical Puerto Rico. Statistical analysis involved stepwise regression on factor scores. The explanatory variables were attributes of flow, hydrograph peaks, and rainfall, categorized into 5 flow periods: (1) the current storm hydrograph, (2) the flow and rainfall since the previous storm event, (3) the previous storm event, (4) 2nd previous storm event, and (5) the 3rd previous storm event. The response variables (storm generated sediment loads and concentrations) were analyzed for three portions of the storm hydrograph: (1) the entire storm, (2) the rising limb, and (3) the recessional limb. Hysteresis differences in sediment concentration between the rising and falling limb were also analyzed using these explanatory variables.Sediment availability in the study basins is related to land use and underlying geology. The supply of sediment and its location in the watershed have a strong influence on how current and previous storm events, and flow and rainfall between storm events, affect sediment loads and concentrations. In basins with limited sediment availability (forest and pasture), previous storm events supply sediment to the channel. This in-channel sediment becomes the source of sediment on the rising limb of the next event and clockwise hysteresis occurs. In the cropland basin with high sediment availability, sediment delivered to the channel during events becomes the source of sediment on the rising limb of the next event and clockwise hysteresis occurs. In the urbanizing basin with high sediment availability, counterclockwise hysteresis is prevalent as stormwater runoff dilutes suspended-sediment concentrations on the rising limb and upland sediment arrives on the hydrograph recession. In the urbanized basin, previous storm events flush sediment from the system. The statistical approaches presented here can be used to generate hypotheses on the location and delivery of watershed sediment sources which can improve the design of appropriate field studies. ?? 2012 .},

We use here an existing geomorphological interpretation of recession dynamics, which links the exponent in the classic recession curve -dQ / dt = kQ?? to the geometric properties of the time-varying drainage network to study the general properties of recession curves across a wide variety of river basins. In particular, we show how the parameter k depends on the initial soil moisture state of the basin and can be made to explicitly depend on an index discharge, representative of initial sub-subsurface storage. Through this framework we obtain a non-dimensional, event-independent, recession curve. We subsequently quantify the variability of k across different basins on the basis of their geometry, and, by rescaling, collapse curves from different events and basins to obtain a generalized, or 'universal', recession curve. Finally, we analyze the resulting normalized recession curves and explain their universal characteristics, lending further support to the notion that the statistical properties of observed recession curves bear the signature of the geomorphological structure of the networks producing them. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The standard conceptual HBV model was originally developed with daily data and is normally operated on daily time step. But many floods in Slovenia are usually flash floods as result of intense frontal precipitation combined with orographic enhancement. Peak discharges are maintained only for hours or even minutes. To use the HBV model for flash flood forecasting, the version of HBV-96 has been applied on the catchment with complex topography with the time step of one hour. The recording raingauges giving hourly values of precipitation have been taken in calibration of the model. The uncertainty of simulated runoff is mainly the result of precipitation uncertainty associated with the mean areal precipitation and is higher for mountainous catchments. Therefore the influence of number of raingauges used to derive the areal precipitation by the method of Thiessen polygons was investigated. The quantification of hydrological uncertainty has been performed by analysis of sensitivity of the HBV model to error in precipitation input. The results show that an error of 10{\%} in the amount of precipitation causes an error of 17{\%} in the peak of flood wave. The polynomial equations showing the relationship between the errors in rainfall amounts and peak discharges were derived for two water stations on the Savinja catchment. Simulated discharges of half-yearly runs demonstrate the applicability of the HBV model for flash flood forecasting using the mesoscale meteorological forecasts of ALADIN/SI model as input precipitation data.},

The objective of this study was to develop a new automated extraction of drainage network model, which can get high-precision continuous drainage network on high-resolution DEM (Digital Elevation Model). The high-resolution DEM need too much computer resources to extract drainage network. The conventional GIS method often can not complete to calculate on high-resolution DEM of big basins, because the number of grids is too large. In order to decrease the computation time, an advanced distributed automated extraction of drainage network model (Adam) was proposed in the study. The Adam model has two features: (1) searching upward from outlet of basin instead of sink filling, (2) dividing sub-basins on low-resolution DEM, and then extracting drainage network on sub-basins of high-resolution DEM. The case study used elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) at 3 arc-second resolution in Zhujiang River basin, China. The results show Adam model can dramatically reduce the computation time. The extracting drainage network was continuous and more accurate than HydroSHEDS (Hydrological data and maps based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales).},

In this work the Model Conditional Processor (MCP) has been extended to the possibility of using two joint Truncated Normal Distributions (TNDs), in order to improve adaptation to low and high flows. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The paper concludes by showing the results of the application of the MCP on two case studies, the Po river in Italy and the Baron Fork river, OK, USA. In the Po river case the data provided by the Civil Protection of the Emilia Romagna region have been used to implement an operational example, where the predicted variable is the observed water level. In the Baron Fork River example, the data set provided by the NOAA's National Weather Service, within the DMIP 2 Project, allowed two physically based models, the TOPKAPI model and TETIS model, to be calibrated and a data driven model to be implemented using the Artificial Neural Network. The three model forecasts have been combined with the aim of reducing the PU and improving the probabilistic forecast taking advantage of the different capabilities of each model approach.},

abstract = {Hydrograph separation is considered as the first step to catchment-scale water balance analysis. A wide variety of hydrograph separation methods exists ranging from empirical to analytical and physical. This study discusses a physically-based approach that combines baseflow separation and event identification with minimal data requirement. The input datasets are basin-average rainfall and discharge time series. Outputs are baseflow time series, the timing of the runoff events, differentiated as single- or multi-peak, and the associated rainfall event time series. To assess the method's feasibility, hydrograph properties are evaluated for both long-term (annual and monthly) and event-scale time series. Results show that the long-term derived baseflow indices are positive (negative) correlated with basin area (runoff coefficient). The event scale analysis shows that the timing-related parameters (i.e. durations of rainfall and flow events and time lag between rainfall to flow events) increase with basin area in terms of magnitude and variability. Similar dependence on basin scale is shown for the water balance-related parameters determined from this analysis, namely event rainfall and baseflow volumes and baseflow index. Water balance parameters are shown to be characterized with less degree of variability for single-peak events relative to multi-peak events.},

However the present analysis also considers the errors inherent to rain gauge, in particular instrumental and representativeness errors. A special emphasis is addressed to the spatial variability of the rainfall in order to appreciate the representativeness error of the rain gauge with respect to the 1 km square average, typical of the radar derived estimate. For this purpose the spatial correlation function of the rainfall is analyzed. The data set consists of 1-year radar data collected by the X-band polarimetric radar HYDRIX??, located in Beauce region (80 km south of Paris). All data were processed in real time using the ZPHI?? algorithm. A dense 25 rain gauge network provided ground comparison data. The various sources of uncertainties (instrumental and representativeness) are then analyzed and quantified for each sensor. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understanding the pathways by which event water contributes to stream stormflow provides insight into stormflow generation mechanisms. We analyze the impact of storm size on the relative contribution of event water to stormflow by using natural variations in the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation and stream water to separate multiple stormflow hydrographs from a single fourth-order, 1212 ha catchment. We extend previous isotope-based hydrograph separations by independently accounting for the contribution of event water via direct channel precipitation to the stream hydrograph. The direct channel precipitation contribution is determined using a numerical model of stream flow routing though the catchment, taking precipitation and digital elevation data as input variables. For the range of storm sizes sampled, having recurrence intervals ranging from less than a week to ???4 months, essentially all the event water in stream stormflow can be attributed to direct channel precipitation. Event water not directly falling on the stream channel indirectly contributes to stormflow by increasing the subsurface discharge of pre-event water to the stream. Neither the hydrograph separation data, field observations during the precipitation events, nor experimental observations of flow in a large-scale natural soil column extracted from the watershed are consistent with macropore flow or groundwater ridging as the primary mechanism responsible for increasing subsurface discharge. Results from a series of artificial rain experiments using the unsaturated natural soil column are consistent with a preferential kinematic flow model and indicate that the discharge of pre-event water to the stream during a storm event may be controlled by kinematic flow processes within the watershed soils. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Predictions of hydrological regimes at ungauged sites are required for various purposes such as setting environmental flows, assessing availability of water resources or predicting the probability of floods or droughts. Four contrasting methods for estimating mean flow, proportion of flow in February, 7-day mean annual low flow, mean annual high flow, the all-time flow duration curve and the February flow duration curve at ungauged sites across New Zealand were compared. The four methods comprised: (1) an uncalibrated national-coverage physically-based rainfall-runoff model (TopNet); (2) data-driven empirical approaches informed by hydrological theory (Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments); (3) a purely empirically-based machine learning regression model (Random Forests); and (4) correction of the TopNet estimates using flow duration curves estimated using Random Forests. Model performance was assessed through comparison with observed data from 485 gauging stations located across New Zealand. Three model performance metrics were calculated: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, a normalised error index statistic (the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data) and the percentage bias. Results showed that considerable gains in TopNet model performance could be made when TopNet time-series were corrected using flow duration curves estimated from Random Forests. This improvement in TopNet performance occurred regardless of two different parameterisations of the TopNet model. The Random Forests method provided the best estimates of the flow duration curves and all hydrological indices except mean flow. Mean flow was best estimated using the already published Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments method. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Its application, however, poses many methodical questions, and throughout the literature numerous solutions have been sought. The quantification of the recession curve involves the selection of an analytical expression, derivation of a characteristic recession and optimization of the recession parameters. A major problem is the high variability encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The segments represent different stages in the outflow process, and a physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession. This paper discusses these elements of recession analysis and reviews different ways of characterizing the baseflow recession rate. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Hydrologic models use relatively simple mathematical equations to conceptualize and aggregate the complex, spatially distributed, and highly interrelated water, energy, and vegetation processes in a watershed. A consequence of process aggregation is that the model parameters often do not represent directly measurable entities and must therefore be estimated using measurements of the system inputs and outputs. During this process, known as model calibration, the parameters are adjusted so that the behavior of the model approximates, as closely and consistently as possible, the observed response of the hydrologic system over some historical period of time. In practice, however, because of errors in the model structure and the input (forcing) and output data, this has proven to be difficult, leading to considerable uncertainty in the model predictions. This paper surveys the limitations of current model calibration methodologies, which treat the uncertainty in the input-output relationship as being primarily attributable to uncertainty in the parameters and presents a simultaneous optimization and data assimilation (SODA) method, which improves the treatment of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling. The usefulness and applicability of SODA is demonstrated by means of a pilot study using data from the Leaf River watershed in Mississippi and a simple hydrologic model with typical conceptual components.},

In this regards, the impact of landslide on roads and highways in the hilly and mountainous terrains has also increased. Non-structural landslide mitigation measures, including early warning and hazard mapping, as well as structural mitigation measures with the application of geosynthetics, have been exploited in localities where rain-triggered landslides are a potential threat to human life and property. For early warning, the use of critical Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) is proposed to be most appropriate. Furthermore, deterministic hazard mapping technique incorporating the modern day geospatial technologies can also provide a useful platform to analyze a number of scenarios including rainfall and land cover/land use variations. Finally, a parametric study on a designed and constructed reinforced soil slope with polyester polymer geogrids revealed that the stiffness of backfill is very sensitive to moisture contents or wetting due to rainfall which can influence the performance of reinforced slope structure. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Still, operational applications of radar rainfall in urban hydrology is limited. The following aspects have to be considered for radar rainfall data use specifically in urban hydrology: the type of the radar, the application requirements on the radar data, the achievable radar data quality, forecast possibilities and limits. Quantitative applications of weather radar to urban hydrology are becoming more mature with better understanding of limitations and achievable accuracy. Research in the US and Europe has led to operational applications of radar to site-specific forecasting of floods and management of sewer overflow during wet weather. The uncertainties and methods for obtaining accurate rainfall measurements at high resolution and with areal extents consistent with urban catchments is a major focus of this article. Evaluation and improvement of quantitative precipitation measurements are described in this overview with specific research and operational examples of radar use in urban hydrology. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {—As part of a long-range program on the hydrology of small watersheds, a corre­ lation between the two-year, one-hour rainfall intensity at 126 recording rainfall stations in northern California and related topographic and climatic parameters has been made. The re­ sulting correlation has a coefficient of correlation of 0.88 and a standard error of 0.067 inch/ hour. With this relation, it is possible to show the variation of rainfall intensity over the area in much greater detail than has hitherto been possible from observed intensity data alone. This paper discusses the parameters employed, the methods of correlation, and the results obtained. Introduction—One of the problems in any study of rainfall intensity is the limited number of stations with record suitable for frequency analy­ sis. For a regional study, data are limited to the hydrologic network stations available since about 1940. After preliminary study, it was decided to limit this analysis to California north of 35° N to avoid introducing large scale climatic factors. In this area approximately 150 station records were available for use. After screening to eliminate records which were too short or were composites from several station locations the number was reduced to 126. The maximum length of record was ten years and the average length substantially less. Conse­ quently the two-year, one hour intensity was adopted as the best choice of a dependent param­ eter. Since clock-hour data were readily avail­ able, these were used although the maximum 60-min values would be somewhat higher. Occasional summer thunderstdrms produce high-intensity rains in California. Because these storms are the result of quite different meterological processes, they were excluded from the analysis by using only the September through April period. Since most of these summer rains fall on dry ground and pro­ duce little runoff, this exclusion does not seem to affect the utility of the results. The general technique utilized is that previously employed by Spreen [1947] Burns [1952], and others for relating mean annual or mean seasonal pre­ cipitation to topography. The coaxial method of graphical correlation [Linsley and others, 1949] was employed because of the flexibility it offers. Since a relatively large number of stations was to be analyzed, data were transcribed onto Key sort punched cards. These cards could be easily strati­ fied and average values computed for each pa­ rameter as needed. The complete study [Linsley, 1956] involved comparison of four alternative relationships. This paper reports only the one which seems to offer the best results. Index daily rainfall—It is a logical assumption that, within a small region where the occurrence of rainfall at all stations is limited to about the same number of hours in a year, hourly intensities will bear some relation to mean annual precipita­ tion. The study area is too large for strict adherence to this assumption and a parameter called index daily rainfall was defined by},

This can be accomplished through numerous interpolation methods, which have different strengths and weaknesses. The accuracy of the resulting continuous surface of rainfall information depends on the density of the point data and observational errors which in turn affect the integrity of hydrological studies that utilize the data as input. In this study four interpolation methods namely; Thiessen Polygon, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Thinplate and Kriging were evaluated at an experimental catchment in South West England at three gauge densities through Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) method. The numbers of rain gauges used for the three densities were 49, 28 and 10 which were translated to 2.75, 4.82, and 13.5 sq.km per gauge since the area of the catchment was 135.2 sq. km.

abstract = {The physical processes governing floods in river basins are highly variable in space and time. Spatial variability produces a very large number of values of the parameters governing production of runoff from hills and its transport through channels. Most of these parameters cannot be measured, and the number of different values that they can take increases with spatial scale. By contrast the aggregated behavior of peak flows exhibits statistical scale invariance at successively larger spatial scales. Statistical scaling is an emergent property of a complex physical system, which is not built into the physical equations. The slopes and the intercepts of log-log linear relationships describing scale invariance are called 'scaling parameters', which can be estimated empirically. Scaling theory provides a new mathematical framework for interpreting empirical scaling parameters in terms of numerical and analytical solutions of physical equations and thereby testing different hypotheses. We illustrate this central idea using three flood-scaling parameters that have been estimated from two experimental basins in the United States, Walnut Gulch, AZ, and Goodwin Creek, MS. Scaling theory unifies spatial scaling flood statistics with physical processes, which has been a long-standing, fundamental open hydrology problem. The scaling framework provides the scientific foundations for solving the global problem of prediction of floods from ungauged and poorly gauged basins. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Streamflow recession has been investigated by a variety of methods, often involving the fit of a model to empirical recession plots to parameterize a non-linear storage–outflow relationship based on the dQ/dt−Q method. Such recession analysis methods (RAMs) are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity, storage capacity, or aquifer thickness and to model streamflow recession curves for regionalization and prediction at the catchment scale. Numerous RAMs have been published, but little is known about how comparably the resulting recession models distinguish characteristic catchment behavior. In this study we combined three established recession extraction methods with three different parameter-fitting methods to the power-law storage–outflow model to compare the range of recession characteristics that result from the application of these different RAMs. Resulting recession characteristics including recession time and corresponding storage depletion were evaluated for 20 meso-scale catchments in Germany. We found plausible ranges for model parameterization; however, calculated recession characteristics varied over two orders of magnitude. While recession characteristics of the 20 catchments derived with the different methods correlate strongly, particularly for the RAMs that use the same extraction method, not all rank the catchments consistently, and the differences among some of the methods are larger than among the catchments. To elucidate this variability we discuss the ambiguous roles of recession extraction procedures and the parameterization of the storage–outflow model and the limitations of the presented recession plots. The results suggest strong limitations to the comparability of recession characteristics derived with different methods, not only in the model parameters but also in the relative characterization of different catchments. A multiple-methods approach to investigating streamflow recession characteristics should be considered for applications whenever possible.},

Recent findings in this topic around the world have been applied for determining critical thresholds by physical or statistical models, combined with rainfall forecasting and near real time monitoring as fundamental component of an early warning system. Landslides are caused by several phenomena, including geological, geomorphologic and anthropogenic dynamics; however, one variable - precipitation - has a uniquely strong capability to cause rapid, intense slope failure. A review of several studies of rainfall-triggered landslides is presented some of who have used statistical tools that define critical thresholds based on intensity and duration rainfall.

The present modeling study is focused upon the Llobregat basin,$\backslash$nthe biggest internal catchment with a drainage area of 5040 km(2). The$\backslash$nfirst objective of the study is the characterization of the watershed$\backslash$nhydrological response to this flash-flood event based on rain gauge data$\backslash$nand the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrological Modeling System$\backslash$n(HEC-HMS) runoff model. The HEC- HMS model has been calibrated using$\backslash$nfive episodes of similar torrential characteristics, and the effects of$\backslash$nthe spatial segmentation of the basin and of the temporal scale of the$\backslash$ninput rainfall field have been examined. These kinds of episodes present$\backslash$nshort recurrence intervals in Mediterranean Spain, and the use of$\backslash$nmesoscale forecast driven runoff simulation systems for increasing the$\backslash$nlead times of the emergency management procedures is a valuable issue to$\backslash$nexplore.

abstract = {The Hydrologist's traditional tool for measuring rainfall is the rain gauge. Rain gauges are relatively cheap, easy to maintain and provide a direct and suitably accurate estimate of rainfall at a point. What rain gauges fail to capture well is the spatial variability of rainfall with time, an important aspect for the credible modelling of a catchment's response to rainfall. This spatial variability is particularly evident at short timescales of up to several days. As the period of accumulation increases, the expected spatial variability is reduced and rain gauges provide improved spatial rainfall estimates. Because of the fractal variability of rainfall in space, simple interpolation between rain gauges does not provide an accurate estimate of the true spatial rainfall field, at short time scales.Weather radar provides (with a single instrument) a highly detailed representation of the spatial structure and temporal evolution of rainfall over a large area. Estimated rainfall rates are derived indirectly from measurements of reflectivity and are therefore subject to a combination of systematic and random errors.This article describes a recently proposed merging technique and presents an application to simulated rainfall fields. The technique employed is Conditional Merging (Ehret, which makes use of Kriging to extract the optimal information content from the observed data. A mean field based on the Kriged rain gauge data is adopted, while the spatial detail from the radar is retained, reducing bias, but keeping the spatial variability observed by the radar. The variance of the estimate is reduced in the vicinity of the gauges where they are able to provide good information on the true rainfall field. Copyright 2005 Royal Meteorological Society},

The former is a multi-model ensemble, based on three mesoscale models (BOLAM, COSMO, and WRF), while the latter, following a single-model approach, is the operational ensemble forecasting system developed within the COSMO consortium, COSMO-LEPS (limited-area ensemble prediction system). {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The meteorological models are coupled with a distributed rainfall-runoff model (TOPKAPI) to simulate the discharge of the Reno River (northern Italy), for a recent severe weather episode affecting northern Apennines.

abstract = {Radar precipitation estimates can improve hydrologic prediction over a range of spatial scales represented by both rural and urban basins. Flooding results from the combination of heavy precipitation and the distributed hydraulic and hydrologic characteristics of the basin. Accuracy and spatial scaling of radar estimated rainfall, and its impact at relevant hydrologic scales is an important determinant of hydrologic prediction accuracy and flood forecasting. Results of simulations using archival radar events are used to demonstrate the sources of uncertainty affecting site-specific flood forecasts within the distributed hydrologic model, Vflo. Radar data used in this analysis are derived from both S-band (NEXRAD/88D) and the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA), polarimetric X-band radars. X-band radars have the capability to provide higher spatial and temporal resolution than the conventional radars operating at S-band. However, compared to S-band, X-band radars have shorter wavelengths and suffer from attenuation, or even total extinction of the radar signal at short ranges from the radar. Degradation of precipitation mapping is a serious concern, especially in heavy precipitation over distances associated with watersheds prone to flooding. Compared to rain gauge accumulations, X-band radar polarimetric rainfall estimates were significantly degraded beyond about 15km from the radars. With rainfall input derived from X-band radars, uncertainty in runoff volume scales with watershed area as a smooth monotonically decreasing function as area increases due to averaging of random errors in the input. Relative to estimates derived from S-band radar, unreliable hydrograph response was produced using X-band polarimetric rainfall estimates as input to a physics-based distributed hydrologic model, especially for watershed areas less than about 20km2. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

A fully coupled subsurface-land surface-atmosphere model is applied over a 150×150 km study area located in Western Germany and ensemble simulations are performed over two convective precipitation events considering two separate model configurations based on groundwater table dynamics. Ensembles are generated by varying the model atmospheric initial conditions following the prescribed ensemble generation method by the German Weather Service in order to account for the intrinsic, internal atmospheric variability. The results demonstrate that especially under strong convective conditions, groundwater table dynamics affect atmospheric boundary layer height, convective available potential energy, and precipitation via the coupling with land surface soil moisture and energy fluxes. Thus, this study suggests that systematic uncertainties may be introduced to atmospheric simulations if groundwater table dynamics are neglected in the model.},

The rainfall and landslide information was used to update the dependency of theminimumlevel of rainfall duration and intensity likely to result in shallow landslides and debris flows established by Nel Caine in 1980. The rainfall intensity– duration (ID) values were plotted in logarithmic coordinates, and it was established that with increased rainfall duration, the minimum average intensity likely to trigger shallow slope failures decreases linearly, in the range of durations from 10 min to 35 days. The minimum ID for the possible initiation of shallow landslides and debris flowswas determined.The threshold curvewas obtained from the rainfall data using an objective statistical technique. To cope with differences in the intensity and duration of rainfall likely to result in shallow slope failures in different climatic regions, the rainfall information was normalized to the mean annual precipitation and the rainy-day normal. Climate information was obtained from the global climate dataset compiled by the Climate Research Unit of the East Anglia University. The obtained global ID thresholds are significantly lower than the threshold proposed by Caine (GeogrAnn A62:23–27, 1980), and lower than other global thresholdsproposedin the literature. The new global ID thresholds can be used in a worldwide operational landslide warning system based on global precipitationmeasurements where local and regional thresholds are not available.},

abstract = {This paper studies the inter-annual precipitation variations in different regions of East Asia from oceans to interior areas in China during 1979 - 2012. The results computed by Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) demonstrate that the annual precipitation changes are mainly related to the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation, East Asian summer monsoon and aerosols. We also found that the increased Sea surface temperature (SST) could explain the precipitation changes over the Northwest Pacific in the dry season (Oct. - May) and the East China Sea and the South China Sea in the rainy season (Jun. - Sep.). The precipitation changes over the ocean unexplained by SST were likely due to the water vapor transport dominated by dynamic factors. With the increased SST, the moisture transported from oceans to interior land was likely redistributed and caused the complicated regional variability of precipitation. Moreover, the impacts of aerosols on cloud and precipitation varied with different pollution levels and different seasons.},

abstract = {One of the less known aspects of operational flood forecasting systems in complex topographic areas is the way how the uncertainties of its components propagate and superpose when they are fed into a hydrological model. This paper describes an experimental framework for investigating the relative contribution of meteorological forcing uncertainties, initial conditions uncertainties and hydrological model parameter uncertainties in the realization of hydrological ensemble forecasts. Simulations were done for a representative small-scale basin of the Swiss Alps, the Verzasca river basin (186km2).For seven events in the time frame from June 2007 to November 2008 it was possible to quantify the uncertainty for a five-day forecast range yielded by inputs of an ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) model (COSMO-LEPS, 16 members), the uncertainty in real-time assimilation of weather radar precipitation fields expressed using an ensemble approach (REAL, 25 members), and the equifinal parameter realizations of the hydrological model adopted (PREVAH, 26 members). Combining the three kinds of uncertainty results in a hydrological ensemble of 10,400 members. Analyses of sub-samples from the ensemble provide insight in the contribution of each kind of uncertainty to the total uncertainty.The results confirm our expectations and show that for the operational simulation of peak-runoff events the hydrological model uncertainty is less pronounced than the uncertainty obtained by propagating radar precipitation fields (by a factor larger than 4 in our specific setup) and NWP forecasts through the hydrological model (by a factor larger than 10). The use of precipitation radar ensembles for generating ensembles of initial conditions shows that the uncertainty in initial conditions decays within the first 48. hours of the forecast. We also show that the total spread obtained when superposing two or more sources of uncertainty is larger than the cumulated spread of experiments when only one uncertainty source is propagated through the hydrological model. The full spread obtained from uncertainty superposition is growing non-linearly. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Estimation of the long-term water balance considers the spatial variability of hydrologic fields, in which drainage basins are considered the basic hydrological control volumes for estimation. A systematic effort has been made to estimate the long term average precipitation field combining rain gauge measurements with existing handmade expert maps as an input trend for a universal Kriging interpolation technique. Evaluation of estimates for actual and potential long-term evapotranspiration was implemented using diverse methods. Results were tested using the long term water balance equation against 200 streamflow gauging stations. No method for actual evapotranspiration showed significant superiority. Overall, we conclude that the magnitude of errors arises fundamentally from deficiencies in the data and the sparsity of the observations.},

abstract = {A physically-based, spatially-distributed model is presented for simulation of surface/subsurface flow and the interactions between these domains. The model is designed for practical application to a wide variety of hydrologic evaluations, at various scales of simulation. The system is represented by the three-dimensional saturated-unsaturated flow equation for the subsurface, coupled with the diffusion wave equation for areal overland flow, both of which are coupled with the diffusion wave equation for flow through a network of streams and channels, including hydraulic structures. Ground surface unevenness at the grid scale is incorporated via the concept of detention storage, and thick vegetation or urban features are included via an obstruction storage exclusion term. Evapotranspiration from the surface and subsurface are modeled using land cover and climatic factors to define the complete water budget using a physically-based formulation. The system of equations is discretized using a fully implicit procedure, with the Newton-Raphson method to handle non-linearities efficiently. Robustness, stability and accuracy of solution are obtained for a wide variety of cases including dry systems and large surface/subsurface interaction fluxes. Adaptive time-stepping schemes and under-relaxation formulas further alleviate the computational burden. Verification and application examples demonstrate the need for a rigorous, fully-coupled solution to the set of equations, for complete hydrologic-cycle analysis. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The performance of urban drainage systems is typically examined using hydrological and hydrodynamic models where rainfall input is uniformly distributed, i.e., derived from a single or very few rain gauges. When models are fed with a single uniformly distributed rainfall realization, the response of the urban drainage system to the rainfall variability remains unexplored. The goal of this study was to understand how climate variability and spatial rainfall variability, jointly or individually considered, affect the response of a calibrated hydrodynamic urban drainage model. A stochastic spatially distributed rainfall generator (STREAP {\&}ndash; {\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}S{\textless}/span{\textgreater}pace-{\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}T{\textless}/span{\textgreater}ime {\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}Re{\textless}/span{\textgreater}alizations of {\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}A{\textless}/span{\textgreater}real {\textless}span style="text-decoration:underline; " class="text"{\textgreater}P{\textless}/span{\textgreater}recipitation) was used to simulate many realizations of rainfall for a 30-year period, accounting for both climate variability and spatial rainfall variability. The generated rainfall ensemble was used as input into a calibrated hydrodynamic model (EPA SWMM {\&}ndash; the US EPA's Storm Water Management Model) to simulate surface runoff and channel flow in a small urban catchment in the city of Lucerne, Switzerland. The variability of peak flows in response to rainfall of different return periods was evaluated at three different locations in the urban drainage network and partitioned among its sources. The main contribution to the total flow variability was found to originate from the natural climate variability (on average over 74 {\%}). In addition, the relative contribution of the spatial rainfall variability to the total flow variability was found to increase with longer return periods. This suggests that while the use of spatially distributed rainfall data can supply valuable information for sewer network design (typically based on rainfall with return periods from 5 to 15 years), there is a more pronounced relevance when conducting flood risk assessments for larger return periods. The results show the importance of using multiple distributed rainfall realizations in urban hydrology studies to capture the total flow variability in the response of the urban drainage systems to heavy rainfall events.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Turbid water can be the source of important sanitary problems in karstic regions. It is the case of the Pays de Caux, in Haute Normandie, where the main resource in drinking water is provided by the chalk aquifer. In the case of the typical binary karst of the Pays de Caux, turbidity results from the input in sinkholes of turbid surface water induced by erosion on the plateaus. At some spring tappings, water may be very turbid in period of intense rainfall. The turbidity observed at a karstic spring is a complex signal which contains a part of direct transfer and a part of resuspension of the particles being transported. The aim of this study is turbidigraph separation, which would permit to distinguish the direct transfer and resuspension components of the turbidigraph. These two components are separated by comparing the elementary surface storm-derived water fluxes and elementary turbidity signals at the spring. The procedure takes place in three phases: (i) spring hydrograph separation by means of a two components mixing model (surface water and karstic groundwater) using specific electrical conductivity, (ii) decomposition of storm-derived water flux and turbidity thanks to the second-derivative method, (iii) comparison of the transfer times (≈ modal times) of the elementary turbidity and surface water flux signals, respectively. The mass corresponding to direct transfer, computed after signal decomposition, is then used to re-calculate a particle recovery rate, which passes so from 51 ± 4 to 37 ± 3{\%}. Relations between particle flux and hydrodynamics show that resuspension can be either the fact of the dynamics of the introduction system, or that of the chalk karstic aquifer in general (case of resuspension not associated to surface water flux). In this sense, evolution of particle flux (and consequently of turbidity) can be also a marker of the karst structure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Models with a fixed structure are widely used in hydrological studies and operational applications. For various reasons, these models do not always perform well. As an alternative, flexible modelling approaches allow the identification and refinement of the model structure as part of the modelling process. In this study, twelve different conceptual model structures from the SUPERFLEX framework are compared with the fixed model structure GR4H, using a large set of 237 French catchments and discharge-based performance metrics. The results show that, in general, the flexible approach performs better than the fixed approach. However, the flexible approach has a higher chance of inconsistent results when calibrated on two different periods. When analysing the subset of 116 catchments where the two approaches produce consistent performance over multiple time periods, their average performance relative to each other is almost equivalent. From the point of view of developing a well-performing fixed model structure, the findings favour models with parallel reservoirs and a power function to describe the reservoir outflow. In general, conceptual hydrological models perform better on larger and/or wetter catchments than on smaller and/or drier catchments. The model structures performed poorly when there were large climatic differences between the calibration and validation periods, in catchments with flashy flows, and in catchments with unexplained variations in low flow measurements.},

abstract = {A framework for a comprehensive synthetic rainfall-runoff database was developed to study catchment response to a variety of rainfall events. The framework supports effective flood risk assessment and management and implements simple approaches. It consists of three flexible components, a rainfall generator, a continuous rainfallrunoff model, and a database management system. The system was developed and tested at two gauged river sections along the upper Tiber River (central Italy). One of the main questions was to investigate how simple such approaches can be applied without impairing the quality of the results. The rainfall-runoff model was used to simulate runoff on the basis of a large number of rainfall events. The resulting rainfallrunoff database stores pre-simulated events classified on the basis of the rainfall amount, initial wetness conditions and initial discharge. The real-time operational forecasts follow an analogue method that does not need new model simulations. However, the forecasts are based on the simulation results available in the rainfall-runoff database (for the specific class to which the forecast belongs). Therefore, the database can be used as an effective tool to assess possible streamflow scenarios assuming different rainfall volumes for the following days. The application to the study site shows that magnitudes of real flood events were appropriately captured by the database. Further work should be dedicated to introduce a component for taking account of the actual temporal distribution of rainfall events into the stochastic rainfall generator and to the use of different rainfall-runoff models to enhance the usability of the proposed procedure. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

This study presents a long-term and high-resolution investigation of soil moisture, surface and subsurface flow using three large-scale lysimeters on a slope with 23.5?? inclination on a landfill site in Karlsruhe, Germany. Data from a 10-year observation period were evaluated for this study, including weekly soil moisture data obtained by neutron probes, continuous discharge data from the land surface and several layers within the soil zone, and hydrometeorological data from a climate station. The results reveal (i) clear temporal and spatial patterns of soil moisture variations down to a depth of 250. cm, (ii) substantially higher discharge and faster percolation rates in the lower part of the lysimeter field, indicating significant downhill flow at various depths within the soil profile, (iii) characteristic threshold values for flow processes in the soil, associated with a hysteresis effect between soil moisture and flow processes. These results can be used as a basis of improved numerical models for the simulation of floods, soil moisture distributions, and vegetation patterns.},

The strength of the k-Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} relationship is characterized by the coefficient of determination R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, which is expected to indicate the basin's ability to hold water for Ndays. The main objective of this study is to examine how R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} value of a basin is related with its physical characteristics. For this purpose, we use streamflow data from 358 basins in the United States and selected 18 physical parameters for each basin. First, we transform the physical parameters into mutually independent principal components. Then we employ multiple linear regression method to construct a model of R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in terms of the principal components. Furthermore, we employ step-wise multiple linear regression method to identify the dominant catchment characteristics that influence R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and their directions of influence. Our results indicate that R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is appreciably related to catchment characteristics. Particularly, it is noteworthy that the coefficient of determination of the relationship between R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and the catchment characteristics is 0.643 for N=45. We found that topographical characteristics of a basin are the most dominant factors in controlling the value of R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. Our results may be suggesting that it is possible to tell about the water holding capacity of a basin by just knowing about a few of its physical characteristics.},

abstract = {Ground-based precipitation data are still the dominant input type for hydrological models. Spatial variability in precipitation can be represented by spatially interpolating gauge data using various techniques. In this study, the effect of daily precipitation interpolation methods on discharge simulations using the semi-distributed SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model over a 30-year period is examined. The study was carried out in 11 meso-scale (119–3935 km2) sub-catchments lying in the Sulej{\'{o}}w reservoir catchment in central Poland. Four methods were tested: the default SWAT method (Def) based on the Nearest Neighbour technique, Thiessen Polygons (TP), Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK). =The evaluation of methods was performed using a semi-automated calibration program SUFI-2 (Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Procedure Version 2) with two objective functions: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the adjusted R2 coefficient (bR2). The results show that: (1) the most complex OK method outperformed other methods in terms of NSE; and (2) OK, IDW, and TP outperformed Def in terms of bR2. The median difference in daily/monthly NSE between OK and Def/TP/IDW calculated across all catchments ranged between 0.05 and 0.15, while the median difference between TP/IDW/OK and Def ranged between 0.05 and 0.07. The differences between pairs of interpolation methods were, however, spatially variable and a part of this variability was attributed to catchment properties: catchments characterised by low station density and low coefficient of variation of daily flows experienced more pronounced improvement resulting from using interpolation methods. Methods providing higher precipitation estimates often resulted in a better model performance. The implication from this study is that appropriate consideration of spatial precipitation variability (often neglected by model users) that can be achieved using relatively simple interpolation methods can significantly improve the reliability of model simulations.},

abstract = {This paper describes in detail a semi-distributed conceptual rainfall-runoff model known as the ARNO model, which is now in widespread use both in land-surface-atmosphere process research and as an operational flood forecasting tool on several catchments in different parts of the world. The model, which derives its name from its first application to the Arno River, incorporates the concepts of a spatial probability distribution of soil moisture capacity and of dynamically varying saturated contributing areas. The ARNO model is characterized by two main components: the first and most important component represents the soil moisture balance, and the second describes the transfer of runoff to the outlet of the basin. The relevance of the soil component emerges from the highly nonlinear mechanism with which the soil moisture content and its distribution controls the dynamically varying size of the saturated areas mainly responsible for a direct conversion of rainfall into runoff. The second component describes the way in which runoff is routed and transferred along the hillslopes to the drainage channels and along the channel network to the outlet of the basin. Additional components, such as the evapotranspiration, snowmelt and groundwater modules, are also described. A discussion on the advantages of the model, calibration requirements and techniques is also presented, together with the physical interpretation of model parameters. Finally, after describing the original calibration of the ARNO model on the Arno basin, and a comparison with several conceptual models, recent applications of the ARNO model, as part of a real-time flood forecasting system, as a tool for investigating land use changes and as an interesting approach to the evaluation of land-surface-atmosphere interactions at general circulation model (GCM) scale, are illustrated.},

abstract = {Rainfall-runoff simulations in urban environments require meteorological input data with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The availability of precipitation data is constantly increasing due to the shift towards more open data sharing. However, the applicability of such data for urban runoff assessments is often unknown. Here, the feasibility of Finnish Meteorological Institute's open rain gauge and open weather radar data as input sources was studied by conducting Storm Water Management Model simulations at a very small (33.5 ha) urban catchment in Helsinki, Finland. In addition to the open data sources, data were also available from two research gauges, one of them located on-site, and from a research radar. The results confirmed the importance of local precipitation measurements for urban rainfall-runoff simulations, implying the suitability of open gauge data to be largely dictated by the gauge's distance from the catchment. Performance of open radar data with 5 min and 1 km2 resolution was acceptable in terms of runoff reproduction, albeit peak flows were constantly and flow volumes often underestimated. Gauge adjustment and advection interpolation were found to improve the quality of the radar data, and at least gauge adjustment should be performed when open radar data are used. Finally, utilizing dual-polarization capabilities of radars has a potential to improve rainfall estimates for high intensity storms although more research is still needed.},

abstract = {Hydrologic modeling and other geophysical applications are sensitive to precipitation forcing data quality, and there are known challenges in spatially distributing gauge-based precipitation over complex terrain. We conduct a comparison of six high-resolution, daily and monthly gridded precipitation datasets over the Western United States. We compare the long-term average spatial patterns, and interannual variability of water-year total precipitation, as well as multi-year trends in precipitation across the datasets. We find that the greatest absolute differences among datasets occur in high-elevation areas and in the maritime mountain ranges of the Western United States, while the greatest percent differences among datasets relative to annual total precipitation occur in arid and rain-shadowed areas. Differences between datasets in some high-elevation areas exceed 200mmyr-1 on average, and relative differences range from 5 to 60{\%} across the Western United States. In areas of high topographic relief, true uncertainties and biases are likely higher than the differences among the datasets; we present evidence of this based on streamflow observations. Precipitation trends in the datasets differ in magnitude and sign at smaller scales, and are sensitive to how temporal inhomogeneities in the underlying precipitation gauge data are handled.},

abstract = {We have conducted extensive hydrologic simulation experiments in order to investigate how the flood scaling parameters in the power-law relationship Q(A) = $\alpha$A$\theta$, between peak-discharges resulting from a single rainfall-runoff event Q(A) and upstream area A, change as a function of rainfall, runoff coefficient (C r) that we use as a proxy for catchment antecedent moisture state, hillslope overland flow velocity (vh), and channel flow velocity (vc), all of which are variable in space. We use a physically-based distributed numerical framework that is based on an accurate representation of the drainage network and apply it to the Cedar River basin (A = 16, 861 km2), which is located in Eastern Iowa, USA. Our work is motivated by seminal empirical studies that show that the flood scaling parameters $\alpha$ and $\theta$ change from event to event. Uncovering the underlying physical mechanism behind the event-to-event variability of $\alpha$ and $\theta$ in terms of catchment physical processes and rainfall properties would significantly improve our ability to predict peak-discharge in ungauged basins (PUB). The simulation results demonstrate how both $\alpha$ and $\theta$ are systematically controlled by the interplay among rainfall duration T, spatially averaged rainfall intensity E[I], as well as E[C r], E[vh], and vc. Specifically, we found that the value of $\theta$ generally decreases with increasing values of E[I], E[C r], and E[vh], whereas its value generally increases with increasing T. Moreover, while $\alpha$ is primarily controlled by E[I], it increases with increasing E[C r] and E[vh]. These results highlight the fact that the flood scaling parameters are able to be estimated from the aforementioned catchment rainfall and physical variables, which can be measured either directly or indirectly. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

High-resolution deuterium mass spectrometry discriminated between storm sewer leaks and other water sources such as direct runoff, bank seepage, and groundwater flow to a stream channel. Isotope hydrograph separation indicates that groundwater or vadose water predominantly contributed to the volume of stream water compared to direct surface runoff during a storm event. Significant differences in delta D in the subsurface suggest that multiple flow components exist beyond the time period of a storm event.

abstract = {TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby, 1979; Beven et al, 1995) was one of the first attempts to model distributed hydrological responses based on variable contributing area concepts. It makes use of an index of hydrological similarity based on an analysis of the topographic data. The index approach was later generalised to take account of spatial variability of soil transmissivities, but no similar spatial analysis of the variability in the rate of the decrease of the transmissivity with depth has yet been examined. This paper shows how the TOPMODEL theory can be extended to handle this spatial variability, using a 2D distribution function of a new soil depth-topographic index of hydrological similarity. A first sensitivity analysis of the effect of variable soil depths on the model predictions for the Maurets catchment, France, is presented. Predicted discharges and calibrated parameter values are not sensitive to the patterns of effective soil depth investigated. Distributed predictions may be more sensitive but raise questions of how to obtain the parameter data required.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of statistical self-similarity, or scaling invariance, in the spatial variability of rainfall, channel network structures and floods has been supported by recent advances in data analyses. This hypothesis is used here to calculate the statistical scaling exponents of peak river flows using a random cascade model of spatial rainfall intensities and the Peano basin as an idealized model of a river basin. The 'maximum contributing set' approximately determines the magnitudes of peak flows in a self-similar manner in different subbasins of the Peano basin. For an instantaneously applied random, spatially uniform rainfall, the Hausdorff dimension of the maximum contributing set appears as the statistical simple scaling exponent of peak flows. This result is generalized to an instantaneously applied cascade rainfall, and it is shown to give rise to statistical multiscaling in peak flows. The multiscaling exponent of peak flows is computed and interpreted as a Hausdorff dimension of a fractal set supporting rainfall intensity on the maximum contributing set of the Peano basin. Potential implications of this interpretation are illustrated using the regional food frequency analysis of the Appalachian flood data in the United States and a rainfall data set from the tropical Atlantic ocean. It is argued that the hypothesis of self-similarity identifies a powerful theoretical framework which can unify a statistical theory of regional flood frequency with important empirical features of topographic, rainfall and flood data sets and distributed rainfall-landform-runoff relationships.},

abstract = {The inclusion of expert knowledge in data-driven streamflow modeling is expected to yield more accurate estimates of river quantities. Modular models (MMs) designed to work on different parts of the hydrograph are preferred ways to implement such approach. Previous studies have suggested that better predictions of total streamflow could be obtained via modular Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained to perform an implicit baseflow separation. These MMs fit separately the baseflow and excess flow components as produced by a digital filter, and reconstruct the total flow by adding these two signals at the output. The optimization of the filter parameters and ANN architectures is carried out through global search techniques. Despite the favorable premises, the real effectiveness of such MMs has been tested only on a few case studies, and the quality of the baseflow separation they perform has never been thoroughly assessed. In this work, we compare the performance of MM against global models (GMs) for nine different gaging stations in the northern United States. Binary-coded swarm optimization is employed for the identification of filter parameters and model structure, while Extreme Learning Machines, instead of ANN, are used to drastically reduce the large computational times required to perform the experiments. The results show that there is no evidence that MM outperform global GM for predicting the total flow. In addition, the baseflow produced by the MM largely underestimates the actual baseflow component expected for most of the considered gages. This occurs because the values of the filter parameters maximizing overall accuracy do not reflect the geological characteristics of the river basins. The results indeed show that setting the filter parameters according to expert knowledge results in accurate baseflow separation but lower accuracy of total flow predictions, suggesting that these two objectives are intrinsically conflicting rather than compatible.},

abstract = {Debris-flows occurring in the area of Cancia (Dolomites, Northeastern Italy) in recent years have exposed the population to serious risk. In response to the recurring hazard, an alarm and monitoring system was installed to provide a sufficient level of safeguard for inhabitants and infrastructures. The data recorded at three rain gauges during debris-flow events has been analysed, taking into consideration the different elevation of the gauges to delineate the storm rainfall distributions. Rainfall data is compared with the occurrence of debris-flows to examine relations between debris-flow initiation and rainfall. In addition, the data is compared with that recorded during debris-flows which occurred under similar or different geological settings in the Eastern Italian Alps, in order to define triggering thresholds. A threshold for debris-flow activity in terms of mean intensity, duration and mean annual precipitation (M.A.P.) is defined for the study area The normalised rainfall and the normalised intensity are expressed as a per cent with respect to M.A.P. This threshold is compared with thresholds proposed by other authors, and the comparison shows that a lower value is obtained, indicating the debris-flow susceptibility of the area. The threshold equations are: R/ M.A.P. = -1.36 {\textperiodcentered} ln(I)+3.93 where I{\textgreater}2mm/h I/M.A.P. = 0.74 {\textperiodcentered} D{\^{}}(-0.56)},

@article{Hayakawa2006,
abstract = {Stream gradients of mountain bedrock rivers in central Japan were examined using GIS and 50-m digital elevation models to discuss the distribution of knickzones. The gradients are classified into local and trend types based on the measurement lengths. The transition rate from the local to trend gradients, i.e. the decreasing rate of gradient with increasing measurement length, is then obtained as the indicator of relative steepness of a river segment, which permits the objective identification of fluvial knickzones. The identified knickzones occur widely in the study area, and indicate that the knickzone is one of the common landforms in Japanese mountain rivers. The knickzones are more abundant in steep upstream reaches of the rivers subjected to active erosion and rapid rock uplift. This suggests a hydraulic origin of the knickzones, which is similar to step-pool morphology but on a much larger scale. Some knickzones in piedmont areas can be, on the other hand, consistent with tectonic faulting at the mountain foot. Although some influences of volcanic activities on the formation of knickzones are observed, regional lithology seems to exert a relatively weak influence on the abundance of knickzones. Knickzones are more consistent with other local mechanisms of fluvial erosion, including reach-scale processes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the last few decades, evolutionary algorithms have emerged as a revolutionary approach for solving search and optimization problems involving multiple conflicting objectives. Beyond their ability to search intractably large spaces for multiple solutions, these algorithms are able to maintain a diverse population of solutions and exploit similarities of solutions by recombination. However, existing theory and numerical experiments have demonstrated that it is impossible to develop a single algorithm for population evolution that is always efficient for a diverse set of optimization problems. Here we show that significant improvements in the efficiency of evolutionary search can be achieved by running multiple optimization algorithms simultaneously using new concepts of global information sharing and genetically adaptive offspring creation. We call this approach a multialgorithm, genetically adaptive multiobjective, or AMALGAM, method, to evoke the image of a procedure that merges the strengths of different optimization algorithms. Benchmark results using a set of well known multiobjective test problems show that AMALGAM approaches a factor of 10 improvement over current optimization algorithms for the more complex, higher dimensional problems. The AMALGAM method provides new opportunities for solving previously intractable optimization problems.},

abstract = {This paper introduces new insights into the hydrochemical$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfunctioning of lowland river systems using fieldbased$\backslash$r$\backslash$nspectrophotometric and electrode technologies. The$\backslash$r$\backslash$nstreamwater concentrations of nitrogen species and phosphorus fractions were measured at hourly intervals on a continuous basis at two contrasting sites on tributaries of the River Thames – one draining a rural catchment, the River Enborne, and one draining a more urban system, The Cut. The measurements complement those from an existing network of multi-parameter water quality sondes maintained across the Thames catchment and weekly monitoring based on grab samples. The results of the sub-daily monitoring show that streamwater phosphorus concentrations display highly complex dynamics under storm conditions dependent on the antecedent catchment wetness, and that diurnal phosphorus and nitrogen cycles occur under low flow conditions. The diurnal patterns highlight the dominance of sewage inputs in controlling the streamwater phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations at low flows, even at a distance of 7 km from the nearest sewage treatment works in the rural River Enborne. The time of sample collection is important when judging water quality against ecological thresholds or standards. An exhaustion of the supply of phosphorus from diffuse and multiple septic tank sources during storm events was evident and load estimation was not improved by sub-daily monitoring beyond that achieved by daily sampling because of the eventual reduction in the phosphorus mass entering the stream during events. The results highlight the utility of sub-daily water quality measurements and the discussion considers the practicalities and challenges of in situ, sub-daily monitoring.},

abstract = {Detailed depiction of hydrological process and its associated pollution processes plays a critical role in environment improvement and management at basin scale. It also provides a useful tool to assess impact of potential factors on hydrological and water quality conditions. However, it was still difficult to well capture some typical characteristics of these complicated processes including built-in nonlinearity and time-variation, water infrastructure regulations, particularly for highly regulated basins. In this study, an integrated approach of hydrological and water quality dynamic simulation was proposed to solve these difficulties and assess the impacts of several anthropogenic disturbances. The Huai River Basin which was highly disturbed and seriously polluted, was selected as the study area. The main anthropogenic activities considered were point source pollution emissions, diffuse pollutant losses and dam regulations. Results showed that the integrated simulation could well capture the variations in water level, water discharge, concentrations of permanganate index (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) in high (2007), normal (2008) and low (2004) flow years at 15 stations in the upper and middle streams of Huai River Basin. The regulation rules of downstream sluices played negative roles on water quality improvement if keeping current pollution sources, while those of middle stream sluices played positive roles on water quality improvement. However, the water quality deterioration was mainly attributed to emission of point source pollution (12{\%}–43{\%}), followed by diffuse pollutant loss (0–23{\%}) and water quantity-oriented dam regulation (− 29{\%}–20{\%}). The study was expected to provide technical supports for the implementation of water pollution control and sustainable water resources management in the Huai River Basin, and give a reference of integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic simulation.},

abstract = {Public participation in scientific data collection is a rapidly expanding field. In water quality surveys, the involvement of the public, usually as trained volunteers, generally includes the identification of aquatic invertebrates to a broad taxonomic level. However, quality assurance is often not addressed and remains a key concern for the acceptance of publicly-generated water quality data. The Open Air Laboratories (OPAL) Water Survey, launched in May 2010, aimed to encourage interest and participation in water science by developing a ‘low-barrier-to-entry' water quality survey. During 2010, over 3000 participant-selected lakes and ponds were surveyed making this the largest public participation lake and pond survey undertaken to date in the UK. But the OPAL approach of using untrained volunteers and largely anonymous data submission exacerbates quality control concerns. A number of approaches were used in order to address data quality issues including: sensitivity analysis to determine differences due to operator, sampling effort and duration; direct comparisons of identification between participants and experienced scientists; the use of a self-assessment identification quiz; the use of multiple participant surveys to assess data variability at single sites over short periods of time; comparison of survey techniques with other measurement variables and with other metrics generally considered more accurate. These quality control approaches were then used to screen the OPAL Water Survey data to generate a more robust dataset. The OPAL Water Survey results provide a regional and national assessment of water quality as well as a first national picture of water clarity (as suspended solids concentrations). Less than 10 {\%} of lakes and ponds surveyed were ‘poor' quality while 26.8 {\%} were in the highest water quality band. It is likely that there will always be a question mark over untrained volunteer generated data simply because quality assurance is uncertain, regardless of any post hoc data analyses. Quality control at all stages, from survey design, identification tests, data submission and interpretation can all increase confidence such that useful data can be generated by public participants.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of some aspects of water quality to climate change was assessed in the Seine River (France) with the biogeochemical model RIVERSTRAHLER, which describes the transformations and fluxes of C, N, P and Si between the main microbiological populations, thewater col- umn and the sediment, along the entire river network. Point and diffuse sources are prescribed, stream temperature un- dergoes a sinusoidal annual cycle constrained by observa- tions, and runoff is calculated by a physically-based land sur- face model. The reference simulation, using meteorological forcing of 1986–1990 and point sources of 1991, compares very well with observations. The climate change simulated by a general circulation model under the SRES emission sce- nario A2 was used to simulate the related changes in runoff and stream temperature. To this end, a statistical analysis was undertaken of the relationships between thewater and air temperatures in the Seine watershed over 1993–1999, using 88 points that correctly sampled the variability of the tribu- taries. Most of stream temperature variance was explained by the lagged moving average of air temperature, with pa- rameters that depended on Strahler stream order. As an inter- esting simplification, stream temperature changes could be approximated by air temperature changes. This modelling framework was used to analyse of the relative influence of the water warming and discharge reduction induced by cli- mate change on biogeochemical water quality in Paris and downstream. Discharge reduction increased phytoplankton growth and oxygen deficits. Water warming decreased dis- solved oxygen, increased phytoplankton biomass during the growth period, and reduced it afterwards, when loss factors dominate. It was also shown that these impacts were en- hanced when point source inputs of nutrient and organic car- bon increased.},

abstract = {The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires that the ecological and chemical status of water bodies in Europe should be assessed, and action taken where possible to ensure that at least "good" quality is attained in each case by 2015. This paper is concerned with the accuracy and precision with which chemical status in rivers can be measured given certain sampling strategies, and how this can be improved. High-frequency (hourly) chemical data from four rivers in southern England were subsampled to simulate different sampling strategies for four parameters used for WFD classification: dissolved phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, pH and water temperature. These data sub-sets were then used to calculate the WFD classification for each site. Monthly sampling was less precise than weekly sampling, but the effect on WFD classification depended on the closeness of the range of concentrations to the class boundaries. In some cases, monthly sampling for a year could result in the same water body being assigned to three or four of the WFD classes with 95{\%} confidence, due to random sampling effects, whereas with weekly sampling this was one or two classes for the same cases. In the most extreme case, the same water body could have been assigned to any of the five WFD quality classes. Weekly sampling considerably reduces the uncertainties compared to monthly sampling. The width of the weekly sampled confidence intervals was about 33{\%} that of the monthly for P species and pH, about 50{\%} for dissolved oxygen, and about 67{\%} for water temperature. For water temperature, which is assessed as the 98th percentile in the UK, monthly sampling biases the mean downwards by about 1 °C compared to the true value, due to problems of assessing high percentiles with limited data. Low-frequency measurements will generally be unsuitable for assessing standards expressed as high percentiles. Confining sampling to the working week compared to all 7 days made little difference, but a modest improvement in precision could be obtained by sampling at the same time of day within a 3 h time window, and this is recommended. For parameters with a strong diel variation, such as dissolved oxygen, the value obtained, and thus possibly the WFD classification, can depend markedly on when in the cycle the sample was taken. Specifying this in the sampling regime would be a straightforward way to improve precision, but there needs to be agreement about how best to characterise risk in different types of river. These results suggest that in some cases it will be difficult to assign accurate WFD chemical classes or to detect likely trends using current sampling regimes, even for these largely groundwater-fed rivers. A more critical approach to sampling is needed to ensure that management actions are appropriate and supported by data.},

This paper aims to assess the scientific value of community-collected data, through examining differences between Waterwatch data and professionally collected data. The study looked at all aspects of volunteer data collection, including data confidence protocols, equipment, and data analysis. All professional data was collated by the Victorian Water Quality Monitoring Network (VWQMN). The parameters examined in this study were turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), pH and total phosphorus. The level of agreement between community-collected data and professional data varied temporally and spatially. Waterwatch data for EC and pH appeared to be very similar to professionally collected data. Equipment used by Waterwatch volunteers for turbidity and total phosphorus appeared to be limited in accuracy to moderate ranges. Overall the VWQMN professionally collected data showed less variance, suggesting greater variability, potentially due to inaccuracies, in volunteer collected data},

abstract = {Hydrologic regimes in tropical and subtropical regions (e.g. hurricanes, tropical storms, and droughts) impact biogeochemical processes in created and restored wetlands with variability of wet/dry seasons and extreme weather events. Our South Florida Wetland Monitoring Network (SFWMN) with three real-time hydrologic, water quality, and meteorological field stations was established by the Everglades Wetland Research Park of Florida Gulf Coast University in the subtropical Southwest Florida, USA, beginning in 2012. The stations include a restored freshwater marsh (RFM) and adjacent meteorological field station; a restored brackish water marsh (RBM); and a created freshwater treatment wetland system and adjacent meterological station (CFTW). Continuous observations of water depth, temperature, salinity, and pH for the period of January 2012 to January 2016 indicate significant differences among the restored freshwater marsh, the restored brackish marsh, and the created freshwater treatment wetlands for water temperature and pH for wet and dry seasons. The brackish wetland salinity fluctuated between 26.16 (in the dry season) to 1.03. ppt (in the wet season).The real-time dataset allowed up-to-date information of the frequency and duration of severe weather events illustrating, for example, that 70{\%} of the 2012 annual rainfall (1129. mm) occurring in July and August with a 75.4. mm precipitation during one event-tropical storm Isaac on August 26-28, 2012. This storm led to a water stage peak in the brackish wetland due to excessive watershed runoff, not tidal surges, and salinity decreased from 22.3 to 5.5. ppt.The coefficient of variation (CV) for water depth and water quality from all wetland monitoring stations exhibited similar variations during all seasons, except when the salinity for the brackish marsh (RBM) had the highest CV values (1.02) in the wet season. Principal component analysis (PCA) at each station identified the variance in water depth and water quality parameters as due to seasonal changes of precipitation in distinct wet and dry seasons. The data from these monitoring stations are also used for research by scholars and students as well as for teaching a better understanding of wetlands dynamics and function in the classroom. As a whole, these stations are being used to bring awareness about the fragile and unique hydrological conditions of wetlands in subtropical Southwest Florida, especially for long-term conditions related to sea level changes and more frequent tropical storms.},

Coarse sampling and interpolation methods are prone to very high uncertainties due to under-representation of high discharge, short duration events. Additionally, important low-flow processes such as diurnal signals linked to point source impacts are missed. Here we demonstrate a solution based on a time-integrated approach to sampling with a standard 24 bottle autosampler configured to take a sample every 7 h over a week according to a Plynlimon design. This is evaluated with a number of other sampling strategies using a two-year dataset of sub-hourly discharge and phosphorus concentration data. The 24/7 solution is shown to be among the least uncertain in estimating load inter-quartile range: 96{\%} to 110{\%} of actual load in year 1 and 97{\%} to 104{\%} in year 2) due to the increased frequency raising the probability of sampling storm events and point source signals. The 24/7 solution would appear to be most parsimonious in terms of data coverage and certainty, process signal representation, potential laboratory commitment, technology requirements and the ability to be widely deployed in complex catchments.},

However methodologies are often simplified to make them accessible to citizen scientists. We tested whether a recent citizen science survey (the OPAL Air Survey) could detect trends in lichen community composition over transects away from roads. We hypothesised that the abundance of nitrophilic lichens would decrease with distance from the road, while that of nitrophobic lichens would increase. The hypothesised changes were detected along strong pollution gradients, but not where the road source was relatively weak, or background pollution relatively high. We conclude that the simplified OPAL methodology can detect large contrasts in nitrogenous pollution, but it may not be able to detect more subtle changes in pollution exposure. Similar studies are needed in conjunction with the ever-growing body of citizen science work to ensure that the limitations of these methods are fully understood.},

abstract = {This study examined the potential of Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) in predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) at Johor River Basin. The river water quality parameters were monitored regularly each month at four different stations by the Department of Environment (DOE) over a period of ten years, i.e. from 1998 to 2007. The following five water quality parameters were selected for the proposed MLP-NN modelling, namely; temperature (Temp), water pH, electrical conductivity (COND), nitrate (NO3) and ammonical nitrogen (NH3-NL). In this study, two scenarios were introduced; the first scenario (Scenario 1) was to establish the prediction model for DO at each station based on five input parameters, while the second scenario (Scenario 2) was to establish the prediction model for DO based on the five input parameters and DO predicted at previous station (upstream). The model needs to verify when output results and the observed values are close enough to satisfy the verification criteria. Therefore, in order to investigate the efficiency of the proposed model, the verification of MLP-NN based on collection of field data within duration 2009-2010 is presented. To evaluate the effect of input parameters on the model, the sensitivity analysis was adopted. It was found that the most effective inputs were oxygen-containing (NO3) and oxygen demand (NH3-NL). On the other hand, Temp and pH were found to be the least effective parameters, whereas COND contributed the lowest to the proposed model. In addition, 17 neurons were selected as the best number of neurons in the hidden layer for the MLP-NN architecture. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, three statistical indexes were used, namely; Coefficient of Efficiency (CE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Coefficient of Correlation (CC). A relatively low correlation between the observed and predicted values in the testing data set was obtained in Scenario 1. In contrast, high coefficients of correlation were obtained between the observed and predicted values for the test sets of 0.98, 0.96 and 0.97 for all stations after adopting Scenario 2. It appeared that the results for Scenario 2 were more adequate than Scenario 1, with a significant improvement for all stations ranging from 4 {\%} to 8 {\%}. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2011.},

Rainfall chemistry is variable and concentrations of most determinands decrease with increasing volume of catch probably due to 'wash out' processes. Two rainfall sites have been monitored, one for each catchment. The rainfall site on the Lambourn shows higher chemical concentrations than the one for the Pang which probably reflects higher amounts of local inputs from agricultural activity, Rainfall quality data at a long-term rainfall site on the Pang (UK National Air Quality Archive) shows chemistries similar to that for the Lambourn site. but with some clear differences. Rainfall chemistries show considerable variation on an event-to-event basis. Average water quality concentrations and flow-weighted concentrations as well as fluxes vary across the sites, typically by about 30{\%}. Stream chemistry is much less variable due to the main Source of water coming from aquifer sources of high storage. The relationship between rainfall and runoff chemistry at the catchment outlet is described in terms of the relative proportions of atmospheric and within-catchment sources. Remarkably, in view of the quantity of agricultural and sewage inputs to the streams, the catchments appear to be retaining both P and N.},

Our study provides a clear understanding of the water quality in the rivers of Lake Taihu Basin based on basin-scale monitoring and a water quality index (WQI) method. From September 2014 to January 2016, four samplings across four seasons were conducted at 96 sites along main rivers. Fifteen parameters, including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, turbidity (tur), permanganate index (CODMn), total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonium (NH4-N), nitrite, nitrate (NO3-N), calcium, magnesium, chloride, and sulfate, were measured to calculate the WQI. The average WQI value during our study period was 59.33; consequently, the water quality was considered as generally “moderate”. Significant differences in WQI values were detected among the 6 river systems, with better water quality in the Tiaoxi and Nanhe systems. The water quality presented distinct seasonal variation, with the highest WQI values in autumn, followed by spring and summer, and the lowest values in winter. The minimum WQI (WQImin), which was developed based on a stepwise linear regression analysis, consisted of five parameters: NH4-N, CODMn, NO3-N, DO, and tur. The model exhibited excellent performance in representing the water quality in Lake Taihu Basin, especially when weights were fully considered. Our results are beneficial for water quality management and could be used for rapid and low-cost water quality evaluation in Lake Taihu Basin. Additionally, we suggest that weights of environmental parameters should be fully considered in water quality assessments when using the WQImin method.},

abstract = {The influence of climate on the relief of mountain ranges has long been supposed but has received little quantitative investigation. The simplified system of a longitudinal river profile in a bedrock channel coupled to a physically based model of orographic precipitation is used to explore how orographically influenced patterns of precipitation affect the relief of fluvially sculpted mountain ranges. It is shown that the impact on the orography depends on the nature of the precipitation regime. Significant changes in relief also occur for imposed temperature changes of realistic magnitude, although the ability of the relief to respond to any given change depends sensitively on its response time and the timescale of the forcing.},

abstract = {We have conducted extensive hydrologic simulation experiments in order to investigate how the flood scaling parameters in the power-law relationship Q(A) = $\alpha$A$\theta$, between peak-discharges resulting from a single rainfall-runoff event Q(A) and upstream area A, change as a function of rainfall, runoff coefficient (C r) that we use as a proxy for catchment antecedent moisture state, hillslope overland flow velocity (vh), and channel flow velocity (vc), all of which are variable in space. We use a physically-based distributed numerical framework that is based on an accurate representation of the drainage network and apply it to the Cedar River basin (A = 16, 861 km2), which is located in Eastern Iowa, USA. Our work is motivated by seminal empirical studies that show that the flood scaling parameters $\alpha$ and $\theta$ change from event to event. Uncovering the underlying physical mechanism behind the event-to-event variability of $\alpha$ and $\theta$ in terms of catchment physical processes and rainfall properties would significantly improve our ability to predict peak-discharge in ungauged basins (PUB). The simulation results demonstrate how both $\alpha$ and $\theta$ are systematically controlled by the interplay among rainfall duration T, spatially averaged rainfall intensity E[I], as well as E[C r], E[vh], and vc. Specifically, we found that the value of $\theta$ generally decreases with increasing values of E[I], E[C r], and E[vh], whereas its value generally increases with increasing T. Moreover, while $\alpha$ is primarily controlled by E[I], it increases with increasing E[C r] and E[vh]. These results highlight the fact that the flood scaling parameters are able to be estimated from the aforementioned catchment rainfall and physical variables, which can be measured either directly or indirectly. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the tropical African and neighboring Atlantic region there is a strong contrast in the properties of deep convection between land and ocean. Here, satellite radar observations are used to produce a composite picture of the life cycle of convection in these two regions. Estimates of the broadband thermal flux from the geostationary Meteosat-8 satellite are used to identify and track organized convective systems over their life cycle. The evolution of the system size and vertical extent are used to define five life cycle stages (warm and cold developing, mature, cold and warm dissipating), providing the basis for the composite analysis of the system evolution. The tracked systems are matched to overpasses of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, and a composite picture of the evolution of various radar and lightning characteristics is built up. The results suggest a fundamental difference in the convective life cycle between land and ocean. African storms evolve from convectively active systems with frequent lightning in their developing stages to more stratiform conditions as they dissipate. Over the Atlantic, the convective fraction remains essentially constant into the dissipating stages, and lightning occurrence peaks late in the life cycle. This behavior is consistent with differences in convective sustainability in land and ocean regions as proposed in previous studies. The area expansion rate during the developing stages of convection is used to provide an estimate of the intensity of convection. Reasonable correlations are found between this index and the convective system lifetime, size, and depth.},

abstract = {This study examines the radar-indicated structures and other features of extreme rain events in the United States over a 3-yr period. A rainfall event is defined as “extreme” when the 24-h precipitation total at one or more stations surpasses the 50-yr recurrence interval amount for that location. This definition yields 116 such cases from 1999 to 2001 in the area east of the Rocky Mountains, excluding Florida. Two-kilometer national composite radar reflectivity data are then used to examine the structure and evolution of each extreme rain event. Sixty-five percent of the total number of events are associated with mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). While a wide variety of organizational structures (as indicated by radar reflectivity data) are seen among the MCS cases, two patterns of organization are observed most frequently. The first type has a line, often oriented east–west, with “training” convective elements. It also has a region of adjoining stratiform rain that is displaced to the north of the line. The second type has a back-building or quasi-stationary area of convection that produces a region of stratiform rain downstream. Surface observations and composite analysis of Rapid Update Cycle Version 2 (RUC-2) model data reveal that training line/adjoining stratiform (TL/AS) systems typically form in a very moist, unstable environment on the cool side of a preexisting slow-moving surface boundary. On the other hand, back-building/quasi-stationary (BB) MCSs are more dependent on mesoscale and storm-scale processes, particularly lifting provided by storm-generated cold pools, than on preexisting synoptic boundaries.},

abstract = {The 2 June 2008 flood-producing storm on the Starzel river basin in South-West Germany is examined as a prototype for organized convective systems that dominate the upper tail of the precipitation frequency distribution and are likely responsible for the flash flood peaks in Central Europe. The availability of high-resolution rainfall estimates from radar observations and a rain gauge network, together with indirect peak discharge estimates from a detailed post-event survey, provided the opportunity to study in detail the hydrometeorological and hydrological mechanisms associated with this extreme storm and the ensuing flood. Radar-derived rainfall, streamgauge data and indirect estimates of peak discharges are used along with a distributed hydrologic model to reconstruct hydrographs at multiple locations. Observations and model results are combined to examine two main questions, (i) assessment of the distribution of the runoff ratio for the 2008 flash flood and how it compares with other less severe floods; and (ii) analysis of how the spatial and temporal distribution of the extreme rainfall, and more specifically storm motion, controls the flood response. It is shown that small runoff ratios (less than 20{\%}) characterized the runoff response and that these values are in the range of other, less extreme, flood events. The influence of storm structure, evolution and motion on the modeled flood hydrograph is examined by using the "spatial moments of catchment rainfall". It is shown that downbasin storm motion (in the range of 0.7-0.9 m s(-1)) had a noticeable impact on flood response by increasing the modeled flood peak by 13 {\%}.},

abstract = {The intense precipitation event that occurred between 3 and 6 November 1994 and caused extensive flooding over Piedmont in northwestern Italy is simulated and tested with respect to various physical aspects, using a meteorological mesoscale model (BOLAM). The period when the most intense rain occurred, mainly covering the second half of 4 and all of 5 November, is examined. A control experiment, starting at 1200 UTC 4 November, simulates the two observed precipitation peaks and captures the magnitude and timing of the most intense precipitation well even at relatively low horizontal resolution (about 30 km). The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses are used to provide the initial and boundary conditions. Model output diagnostics and comparison with observations indicate that most of the precipitation is associated with a prefrontal low-level jet, ahead of the cold front, impinging upon the orography of the region (Alps and Apennines). The model simulates a multiple rainband and frontal structure whose evolution determines both intensity and location of the prefrontal warm and moist flow. Almost all of the simulated precipitation over the Alps forms in the middle–low troposphere through forced ascent, whereas part of the secondary maximum, observed over the Apennines, is of convective type. Sensitivity experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of orography, surface fluxes, and latent heat exchange processes in the atmosphere. The role of the orography is crucial in determining distribution and amount of precipitation, whereas sensible and latent heat fluxes from the Mediterranean Sea (over the period considered) enhanced only the convective precipitation. Distinct dynamical effects, important for the amount and the spatial distribution of precipitation, are found to be associated with warming due to condensation and cooling due to evaporation and melting of precipitation. The latter process seems to be responsible for the simulated formation of rainbands and complex evolution of the cold front over the western Mediterranean. The multiple front life cycle and propagation feeds back on the simulated precipitation distribution, affecting the location of the prefrontal moist flow. Condensation affects the atmospheric effective stratification where the flow impinges on the orography, determining the flow regime (orographic lifting vs blocking and flow around), which, in turn, has an important impact on precipitation.},

abstract = {The extent to which orography may be a product of climate-erosion interactions is largely unknown. One grand challenge is to quantify the precipitation regimes of mountainous regions at the spatial and temporal scales relevant for investigating the interplay of erosion and tectonics in active orogens. In this paper, our objective is to synthesize recent research integrating numerical model simulations, satellite data, and surface observations in the Himalaya to elucidate the role of weather and climate in mountain evolution. We focus on the seasonal and interannual space-time variability of precipitation in the Great Himalayas by studying two preeminent storm regimes in detail—monsoon onsets and depressions in general, and wintertime Western Disturbances (cold season events). High-resolution simulations of heavy precipitation storms for two monsoon onset conditions (1999 and 2001) and one wintertime storm (2000) are used to illustrate the complex patterns of interaction between the mountains and the atmosphere, and to show how these affect the spatial distribution of precipitation. Along with observations from an existing ground-based network, these simulations provide unique insights into the space-time features of seasonal and inter-annual variability of precipitation. Our analysis indicates that the trajectory of monsoon storms during onset events exerts a strong control on the precipitation amounts and rainfall penetration into the rain shadow. Spatial variability of subsequent storm tracks in any given year helps explain the interannual variability of monsoon precipitation. Both observational data and our simulations define striking spatial variability in precipitation on upwind and downwind fianks of ridges that project into obliquely impinging storms. Specifically, as southeasterly monsoon winds encounter north-south oriented ridges, forced lifting of moist air enhances precipitation on the upwind fianks, whereas less precipitation occurs on downwind fianks. This variability is observed at spatial scales as short as ∼10 km—a distance equivalent to the spacing of major ridge crests. Because infrequent, singular storm events appear to control the mass input to glaciers, and may determine the frequency and spatial distribution of landslides, these findings provide physically based insight into decoupling high-frequency (seasonal to interannual time scales) from low-frequency (multidecadal to centennial and longer time scales) signals in the interpretation of climate and erosion records in the Himalayas. Furthermore, this research suggests that integrative studies aimed at unraveling the role of climate in landscape evolution must include consideration of storm frequency and intensity along with spatial variability at scales consistent with regional climate forcing.},

This study is intended to depict features of seasonal variations of the vertical gradient of rainfall rate using TRMM PR data from 1998 to 2000. The features of downward decreasing (DD) or downward increasing (DI) rainfall rate in the lower part of the vertical profile are focused on. Horizontal maps were made showing decreasing/increasing characteristics in the vertical gradient of rainfall rate over Asia. The pattern showed a clear land–ocean contrast and had monthly variation as the monsoon progressed in Asia. The DD pattern migrated northward around the monsoon onset and withdrew southward in the retrogressing period. The seasonal march of the DD pattern was clear especially over the India subcontinent. The DD seemed to be bordering monsoon rainfall over India. Seasonal changes in characteristics of the vertical profile were observed and are reflected in the horizontal extent of rain and the storm height. It is inferred that large storm systems tend to have high storm height and DD profiles. Most isolated rain systems with low storm height show a DI profile. The DD profile often appears around the border between dry and wet regions and occurs over the wet land.},

Estimation of historical discharge and the incorporation of uncertainty for the at-site and regional flood frequency analysis were performed with an empirical rainfall-runoff assessment as well as stochastic and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. Results for each of the ungauged basins include flood frequency, severity, seasonality and triggers (synoptic meteorological situations). The reconstructed data series clearly demonstrates how uncertainty can be reduced by including historical information, but also points to the considerable influence of different approaches on quantile estimation.

abstract = {The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) has made it possible for the first time to evaluate global characteristics of vertical structures of rainfall over monsoon Asia. This study is intended to depict features of seasonal variations of the vertical gradient of rainfall rate using TRMM PR data from 1998 to 2000. The features of downward decreasing (DD) or downward increasing (DI) rainfall rate in the lower part of the vertical profile are focused on. Horizontal maps were made showing decreasing/increasing characteristics in the vertical gradient of rainfall rate over Asia. The pattern showed a clear land–ocean contrast and had monthly variation as the monsoon progressed in Asia. The DD pattern migrated northward around the monsoon onset and withdrew southward in the retrogressing period. The seasonal march of the DD pattern was clear especially over the India subcontinent. The DD seemed to be bordering monsoon rainfall over India. Seasonal changes in characteristics of the vertical profile were observed and are reflected in the horizontal extent of rain and the storm height. It is inferred that large storm systems tend to have high storm height and DD profiles. Most isolated rain systems with low storm height show a DI profile. The DD profile often appears around the border between dry and wet regions and occurs over the wet land.},

abstract = {The linkages between the space-time variability of observed clouds, rainfall, large-circulation patterns and topography in northern India and the Himalayas were investigated using remote sensing data. The research purpose was to test the hypothesis that cloudiness patterns are dynamic tracers of rainstorms, and therefore their temporal and spatial evolution can be used as a proxy of the spatial and temporal organization of precipitation and precipitation processes in the Himalayan range during the monsoon. The results suggest that the space-time distribution of precipitation, the spatial variability of the diurnal cycle of convective activity, and the terrain (landform and altitudinal gradients) are intertwined at spatial scales ranging from the order of a few kms (1-5 km) up to the continental-scale. Furthermore, this relationship is equally strong in the time domain with respect to the onset and intra-seasonal variability of the monsoon. Infrared and microwave imagery of cloud fields were analyzed to characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of mesoscale convective weather systems and short-lived convection in Northern India, the Himalayan range, and in the Tibetan Plateau during three monsoon seasons (1999, 2000 and 2001). The life cycle of convective systems suggests landform and orographic controls consistent with a convergence zone constrained to the valley of the Ganges and the Himalayan range, bounded in the west by the Aravalli range and the Garhwal mountains and in the East by the Khasi Hills and the Bay of Bengal, which we call the Northern India Convergence Zone (NICZ). The NICZ exhibits strong nighttime activity along the south-facing slopes of the Himalayan range, which is characterized by the development of shortlived convection (1-3 h) aligned with protruding ridges between 1:00 and 3:00 AM. The intra-annual and inter-annual variability of convective activity in the NICZ were assessed with respect to large-scale synoptic conditions, monsoon activity in the Bay of Bengal, and the modulating role of orography. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and canonical correlation (CC) analysis suggest that joint modes of variability of monsoon weather and topography, which we call orographic land-atmosphere interactions, modulate the space-time variability of cloudiness in the region. Finally, scaling analysis of cloudiness suggests three different scaling regimes of orographic land-atmosphere interactions: 1) a synoptic-scale regime (greater than or equal to70-80km); 2) an orographic meso-beta regime (30-70 km) associated with the succession of wide valleys and bulky terrain features; and 3) an orographic meso-a regime (less than or equal to30 km) associated with the complex succession of protruding south-facing ridges and narrow valleys that characterize the Himalayan foothills between altitudes of 3 000 and 5 000 m elevations.},

abstract = {This monograph is the result of a multi-year effort that began with the organization of a workshop designed to bring researchers and forecasters together to discuss current progress and challenges in mountain weather. The chapters in this monograph represent the topics from this workshop, the Mountain Weather Workshop, which took place in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, August 5--8, 2008. The inspiration for the workshop arose under the guidance of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) Mountain Meteorology Committee. This monograph will provide readers with a broad understanding of the fundamental principles driving flow over complex terrain and provide historical context for recent developments and future direction for researchers and forecasters. For academic researchers, the monograph will provide some insight into issues important to the forecasting community. For the forecasting community, we hope the monograph will provide training on fundamentals of flows specific to mountainous regions which are notoriously difficult to predict, understanding of current research challenges, and an opportunity to learn about the latest contributions and advancements to the field. The monograph begins with an overview of mountain weather and forecasting challenges specific to complex terrain (Chapter 1). This is followed by chapters that focus on diurnal mountain/valley flows that develop under calm conditions (Chapter 2) and dynamically-driven winds under strong forcing (Chapter 3). The focus then shifts to other specific phenomena that are difficult to understand and predict in mountain regions: Alpine foehn (Chapter 4) and boundary layer and air quality issues (Chapter 5). The following two chapters address processes that bring wet mountain weather in the form of rain, snow or other hydrometeors, with a discussion of specific orographic precipitation processes (Chapter 6) and the details of microphysics parameterizations (Chapter 7). Having covered the major physical processes, the monograph shifts to observation and modeling techniques used in mountain regions. First, a detailed discussion of field measurements in complex terrain is given (Chapter 8). Then, the following two chapters describe the basics of mesoscale numerical modeling (Chapter 9) and model configuration and physical parameterizations such as turbulence (Chapter 10). The monograph concludes with a chapter that discusses the current state of research and forecasting in complex terrain, including a vision of how to bridge the gap in the future (Chapter 12).},

abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have regions of both convective and stratiform precipitation, and they develop mesoscale circulations as they mature. The upward motion takes the form of a deep-layer ascent drawn into the MCS in response to the latent heating and cooling in the convective region. The ascending layer overturns as it rises but overall retains a coherent layer structure. A middle level layer of inflow enters the stratiform region of the MCS from a direction determined by the large-scale flow and descends in response to diabatic cooling at middle-to-low levels. A middle level mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) develops in the stratiform region, prolongs the MCS, and may contribute to tropical cyclone development. The propagation of an MCS may have a discrete component but may further be influenced by waves and disturbances generated both in response to the MCS and external to the MCS. Waves of a larger scale may affect the propagation velocity by phase locking with the MCS in a cooperative mode. The horizontal scale of an MCS may be limited either by a balance between the formation rate of convective precipitation and dissipation of stratiform precipitation or by the Rossby radius of the MCV. The vertical redistribution of momentum by an MCS depends on the size of the stratiform region, while the net vertical profile of heating of the large- scale environment depends on the amount of stratiform rain. Regional variability of the stratiform rain from MCSs affects the large-scale circulation's response to MCS heating.},

abstract = {Afternoon/evening near-coastal convection over land is easily understood as a response to solar heating of the land, turbulent transfer of heat and moisture to the boundary layer, and lifting of air by vigorous sea-breeze fronts. Subtler processes apparently underlie the late night and morning convection that is prevalent over coastal waters throughout the Tropics. Sensitivity tests using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5), and further diagnoses of the control run described in Part II, are used to explore these processes. Prior studies have speculated that “land-breeze” circulations, analogous but opposite to the sea breeze, drive offshore convection at night. However, nighttime radiative cooling of land and the associated thermal breezes are much weaker than the corresponding daytime processes, especially under humid tropical skies. Analysis of model mean soundings reveals that modest (fractions of a degree Celsius) temperature changes near the 800-hPa level change the sign of the buoyancy of low-level air, from negative (inhibited) to positive (convecting) after about midnight in the coastal zone. These diurnal temperature changes are seen to be signatures of a diurnal gravity wave with a propagation speed of ∼15 m s−1, similar to the speed of motion of the diurnal seaward sweep of convection seen in satellite data as well as in the model. This wave radiates from the diurnally oscillating heat source of the daytime mixed layer, raised up into the stratified layers of the atmosphere by elevated terrain. A surprising finding is that the model mean rainfall field is almost the same in a simulation without diurnally varying solar radiation.},

abstract = {About half the world's freshwater resources come from precipitation (rain and snow) in mountainous regions. Understanding how climate and environmental change can impact monsoon rainfall, which is the dominant freshwater source on mountain slopes and adjacent lowlands in the tropics and subtropics, is therefore an important question of global implications. The diurnal cycle of orographic rainfall (e.g., where it rains, how much it rains, how fast it rains, how long it rains, and at what time of day it rains) varies from one mountain region to another, and in the same region it can vary greatly with elevation and landform. Heavy rainfall is associated with landslides and flash flooding that cause short-term landform and vegetation disturbances and often loss of life and property. By contrast, because of its ubiquity and space-time persistence independently of the variability in large-scale forcing, light rainfall ({\textless}2-5 mm h-1) is de facto water lifeline of mountain environments. The vulnerability of headwater catchments and cloud forests to aridification presents a key challenge to the sustainability of mountain environments and freshwater resources. Changes in fog and rainfall intensities affect canopy harvesting and interception of precipitation, infiltration, and runoff processes, and consequently evapotranspiration, surface energy balance, and boundary layer conditions, which ultimately feedback into cloud formation and rainfall processes.Mountains remain among the least observed environments of the planet. Improving observing systems of the water cycle in mountainous regions at the global scale, and in particular the measurement of fog, clouds, and rainfall, both on the ground and from satellites, is essential to improve our understanding of the water cycle and our ability to address climate vulnerabilities toward sustainable water management.

The physical mechanisms involved comprise a rich set of interactions encompassing fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and micron-scale cloud processes, as well as being dependent on the larger-scale patterns of the atmo-spheric general circulation. Investigations into orographic precipitation have pursued three parallel tracks of inquiry: observations, theory, and modeling. Significant ad-vances have been made in each over the last few decades, and these are summarized and synthesized here. While many aspects of the basic mechanisms responsible for orographic precipitation have been understood, important issues remain unresolved. The sheer number of contributing processes, together with their convoluted interac-tions, make the quantitative prediction of precipitation in complex terrain a very hard task. However, while prediction of precipitation amounts for any given event may be difficult, various lines of evidence suggest that the patterns of orgraphic precipitation, even on scales of a few kilometers, are much more robust.},

abstract = {Oregon's sharp east-west climate transition was investigated using a linear model of orographic precipitation and four datasets: (a) interpolated annual rain gauge data, (b) satellite-derived precipitation proxies (vegetation and brightness temperature), (c) streamflow data for a small catchment, and (d) stable isotope analysis of water samples from streams. The success of the linear model against these datasets suggests that the main elements of the model (i.e., airflow dynamics, cloud time delays, condensed water advection, and leeside evaporation) are behaving reasonably, although the high Oregon terrain may push the linear theory beyond its range of applicability. A key parameter in the linear model is the cloud delay time (tau), encapsulating the action of orographic cloud processes. Each dataset was examined to see if it can constrain the tau values. The statewide precipitation patterns from rain gauge and satellite constrain the tau values only within a broad range from about 500 to 5000 s. A focus on the sharp gradient on the lee slopes of the Cascades suggests that tau values in the range of 1800-2400 s are preferred. The study of the small Alsea watershed constrains tau little, as it receives a mixture of upslope and spillover precipitation. Stable isotope ratios in stream water indicate an atmospheric drying ratio of about 43{\%}, requiring an average cloud physics delay time greater than T = 600 s.},

abstract = {Satellite infrared data and in situ surface measurements from the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA CORE) are used to examine the diurnal variations of deep convection in two distinct large-scale flow regimes over the western Pacific warm pool. Large-scale atmospheric dynamic and radiative processes strongly affect the life-cycle of deep convective systems in the tropics. the observed diurnal variation of tropical cloud systems suggests that diurnal heating of the tropical atmosphere and ocean surfaces provides favoured conditions in the afternoon for the formation of cloud systems and, as the cloud systems grow and decay with time, the diurnal cycle of cloudiness reflects the life-cycle (initiation, growth, and dissipation) of cloud systems. During the convectively suppressed phases of the intra-seasonal oscillation (ISO), the cloud systems are spatially small and their lifetimes are generally short ({\textless} 3 h). They form, reach maximum size, and die preferentially in the afternoon, at the time of day when the ocean surface and overlying atmospheric surface layer are warmest from solar heating. During the convectively active phases of the ISO, the cold cloud coverage is dominated by spatially large, long-lived cloud systems. They tend to form in the afternoon (1400-1900 lst) and reach a maximum areal extent of very cold cloud tops ({\textless} 208 K) before dawn (0000-0600 lst). As part of their life-cycle, the subsequent decay of these large systems extends into the next day; the satellite-observed maximum cloud coverage is dominated by successively warmer cloud tops, from 208-235 K in the early afternoon (∼ 1400 lst) to 235-260 K in the early evening (∼ 1800 lst). Meanwhile the frequency of small cloud systems exhibits two peaks-one in the afternoon and the other in the predawn hours. the latter is evidently triggered by outflows from the large convective systems. The life-cycle of the large, long-lasting convective systems introduces horizontal variability into the pattern of observed cold cloud tops during the active phases of the ISO. Because the life-cycle of large convective systems can take up to a day, they leave the boundary layer filled with air of lower moist-static energy and a cloud canopy that partially shades the ocean surface from the sunlight the following day. So the day after a major large convective system, the surface conditions do not favour another round of convection; therefore, convection occurs in neighbouring regions unaffected by the previous convective systems. We call this spatially selective behaviour of the large systems diurnal dancing. the boundary-layer recovery phase leads to a tendency for the large systems to occur every other day at a given location. This 2-day periodicity appears to phase-lock with westward-propagating equatorial inertio-gravity waves of similar frequency. the combination of the diurnal surface-cloudradiation interaction and equatorial inertio-gravity waves may explain the observed westward-propagating 2-day disturbances in cold cloud tops over the warm pool.},

abstract = {Numerical studies by the authors and others of the 1994 Piedmont flood show that the orographically modified flow was a critical element for the production of extraordinary rainfall. To uncover the precise mechanism of orographic rainfall occurring in full-physics MM5 simulations of the 1994 Piedmont flood, the authors carried out simulations with the same real-data initial and boundary conditions, but with the real orography replaced by an idealized one. With excellent agreement between real and idealized orography on the rainfall rate versus time in the Piedmont area, analysis of the idealized-orography simulation provides a clear picture of the models mechanism of orographically induced rainfall. As noted in previous studies of the 1994 Piedmont case, a moist saturated airflow has a reduced effective static stability and tends to flow over the mountains, while an unsaturated airstream is stable and tries to flow around (toward the left in the Northern Hemisphere). In the 1994 Piedmont case, there was a strong horizontal gradient of moisture; thus the western moist part of the airstream flows over, while the eastern drier part is deflected westward around the obstacle, and so a convergence is produced between the airstreams. This effect is explored using a simple version of MM5 wherein the flow, moisture distribution, and idealized orography are varied within the observed range. Quantitative as well as qualitative rainfall rates and flow features of the full-physics MM5 simulations are captured with the simple model.},

abstract = {The Asian summer monsoon is organized into distinct convection centers, but the mechanism for this organization is not well understood. Analysis of new satellite observations reveals that narrow mountain ranges are an important organizing agent anchoring monsoon convection centers on the windward side. The Bay of Bengal convection, in particular, features the heaviest precipitation on its eastern coast because of orographic lifting as the southwest monsoon impinges on the coastal mountains of Myanmar ( also known as Burma). This is in contrast to the widely held view that this convection is centered over the open ocean as implied by coarse-resolution datasets, a view that would require an entirely different explanation for its formation. Narrow in width and modest in height ({\textless}= 1 km), these mountains are hardly mentioned in conceptual depictions of the large- scale monsoon and poorly represented in global climate models. The numerical simulations of this study show that orographic rainbands are not a local phenomenon but exert far-reaching effects on the continental-scale monsoon. The realization that these overlooked geographical features are an important element of the Asian monsoon has important implications for studying the monsoon in the past, present, and future.},

The paper starts with an overview of flash floods and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of, and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996???2011) but more extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation. Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective contribution to rainfall, introducing the ?? parameter as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as a multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events. The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values of precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain this positive trend in flash flood events. The ?? parameter has been also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short and local events, usually with daily ?? values above 0.5, while the minimum threshold of daily ?? for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.},

abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

abstract = {An approach to forecasting the potential for flash flood–producing storms is developed, using the notion of basic ingredients. Heavy precipitation is the result of sustained high rainfall rates. In turn, high rainfall rates involve the rapid ascent of air containing substantial water vapor and also depend on the precipitation efficiency. The duration of an event is associated with its speed of movement and the size of the system causing the event along the direction of system movement. This leads naturally to a consideration of the meteorological processes by which these basic ingredients are brought together. A description of those processes and of the types of heavy precipitation–producing storms suggests some of the variety of ways in which heavy precipitation occurs. Since the right mixture of these ingredients can be found in a wide variety of synoptic and mesoscale situations, it is necessary to know which of the ingredients is critical in any given case. By knowing which of the ingredients is most important in any given case, forecasters can concentrate on recognition of the developing heavy precipitation potential as mete- orological processes operate. This also helps with the recognition of heavy rain events as they occur, a chal- lenging problem if the potential for such events has not been anticipated. Three brief case examples are presented to illustrate the procedure as it might be applied in operations. The cases are geographically diverse and even illustrate how a nonconvective heavy precipitation event fits within this methodology. The concept of ingredients-based forecasting is discussed as it might apply to a broader spectrum of forecast events than just flash flood forecasting.},

This section of coastline constitutes a steep, approximately two-dimensional north–south-oriented orographic barrier.

The along-barrier pressure gradient and low-level winds increased with time along the coastal zone and reached a maximum as the front made landfall. Stably stratified prefrontal flow was strongly blocked by the orography, resulting in a confluent transition from pervasive southwesterly winds offshore to a narrow zone of accelerated south-southwesterly flow near the coast, where wind speeds approached 30 m s−1 at a height of 750 m above mean sea level.

abstract = {The extent to which orography may be a product of climate-erosion interactions is largely unknown. One grand challenge is to quantify the precipitation regimes of mountainous regions at the spatial and temporal scales relevant for investigating the interplay of erosion and tectonics in active orogens. In this paper, our objective is to synthesize recent research integrating numerical model simulations, satellite data, and surface observations in the Himalaya to elucidate the role of weather and climate in mountain evolution. We focus on the seasonal and interannual space-time variability of precipitation in the Great Himalayas by studying two preeminent storm regimes in detail—monsoon onsets and depressions in general, and wintertime Western Disturbances (cold season events). High-resolution simulations of heavy precipitation storms for two monsoon onset conditions (1999 and 2001) and one wintertime storm (2000) are used to illustrate the complex patterns of interaction between the mountains and the atmosphere, and to show how these affect the spatial distribution of precipitation. Along with observations from an existing ground-based network, these simulations provide unique insights into the space-time features of seasonal and inter-annual variability of precipitation. Our analysis indicates that the trajectory of monsoon storms during onset events exerts a strong control on the precipitation amounts and rainfall penetration into the rain shadow. Spatial variability of subsequent storm tracks in any given year helps explain the interannual variability of monsoon precipitation. Both observational data and our simulations define striking spatial variability in precipitation on upwind and downwind fianks of ridges that project into obliquely impinging storms. Specifically, as southeasterly monsoon winds encounter north-south oriented ridges, forced lifting of moist air enhances precipitation on the upwind fianks, whereas less precipitation occurs on downwind fianks. This variability is observed at spatial scales as short as ∼10 km—a distance equivalent to the spacing of major ridge crests. Because infrequent, singular storm events appear to control the mass input to glaciers, and may determine the frequency and spatial distribution of landslides, these findings provide physically based insight into decoupling high-frequency (seasonal to interannual time scales) from low-frequency (multidecadal to centennial and longer time scales) signals in the interpretation of climate and erosion records in the Himalayas. Furthermore, this research suggests that integrative studies aimed at unraveling the role of climate in landscape evolution must include consideration of storm frequency and intensity along with spatial variability at scales consistent with regional climate forcing.},

@article{Hilgendorf1998,
abstract = {While mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are major contributors to severe weather and precipitation in the central United States, details of their evolution are still not fully understood. In particular, recent observational and modeling studies have indicated that many MCSs tend to exhibit an asymmetric precipitation pattern during the mature-to-later stages of their life cycles. However, to what extent and how this evolution occurs in all cases is still a matter of conjecture. The recently established WSR-88D network has afforded the opportunity to investigate the evolution of MCSs in greater detail than has been possible in the past. As a preliminary effort in this direction, 13 MCSs having leading line-trailing stratiform structures that occurred over the lower Midwest during May and June 1995 have been studied. It is found that indeed there does appear to be an evolution of such MCSs toward asymmetry later in their life cycles; however, the nature of the evolution is complex. The trailing stratiform region develops an asymmetric pattern (stratiform precipitation located toward the northern edge of the MCS) well before the system reaches maturity. The convective line also evolves to an asymmetric pattern (the most intense convective cells concentrated along the southern end of the line), but the appearance of asymmetry occurs several hours later than it does in the stratiform component. The limited sample size, however, precludes definitive conclusions about the significance of this timing difference. Contributions to asymmetry by hydrometeor advection in the along-line component of the flow aloft have also been inferred from sounding data. Results indicate that the system-relative, along-line flow in the pre-MCS environment is comparable to and often greater than the cross-line flow. This evidence suggests that both along-line and cross-line, system-relative flows, along with other processes (e.g., Coriolis effects), may contribute to an evolution toward asymmetry.},

abstract = {AbstractSatellite radar and radiometer data indicate that subtropical South America has some of the deepest and most extreme convective storms on Earth. This study uses the full 15-yr TRMM Precipitation Radar dataset in conjunction with high-resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to better understand the physical factors that control the climatology of high-impact weather in subtropical South America. The occurrence of intense storms with an extreme horizontal dimension is generally associated with lee cyclogenesis and a strengthening South American low-level jet (SALLJ) in the La Plata basin. The orography of the Andes is critical, and model sensitivity calculations removing and/or reducing various topographic features indicate the orographic control on the initiation of convection and its upscale growth into mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Reduced Andes experiments show more widespread convective initiation, weaker average storm intensity, and more rapid propagation of the MCS to the east (reminiscent of the MCS life cycle downstream of lower mountains such as the Rockies). With reduced Andes, lee cyclogenesis and SALLJ winds are weaker, while they are stronger in increased Andes runs. The presence of the Sierras de C{\'{o}}rdoba (secondary mountain range east of the Andes in Argentina) focuses convective initiation and results in more intense storms in experiments with higher Andes. Average CAPE and CIN values for each terrain modification simulation show that reduced Andes runs had lower CIN and CAPE, while increased Andes runs had both stronger CAPE and CIN. From this research, a conceptual model for convective storm environments leading to convective initiation has been developed for subtropical South America.},

As is typical of flash floods along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, rapidly rising streamflow proceeded to move downhill (eastward) into Calgary.A meteorological analysis traces an antecedent Rossby wave train across the North Pacific Ocean, starting with intense baroclinic development over East Asia on 11 June. Subsequently, downstream Rossby wave development occurred across the North Pacific; a 1032-hPa subtropical anticyclone located northeast of Hawaii initiated a southerly atmospheric river into Alaska, which contributed to the development of a cutoff anticyclone over Alaska and a Rex block (ridge to the north, cyclone to the south) in...},

@article{Marra2014a,
abstract = {This work aims to evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of radar rainfall estimates for the identification of debris flow occurrence rainfall thresholds. Observations from a C-band weather radar and raingauge data are analyzed for seven convective rainfall events that triggered 117 debris flows in the Upper Adige river basin (Eastern Italian Alps). Four radar rainfall scenarios characterized by incrementally increasing accuracy are used for the estimation of rainfall intensity-duration thresholds. Error sources considered in the radar correction chain include beam blockage, attenuation and vertical profile of reflectivity. The impact of rainfall accuracy on the estimation of the intensity-duration thresholds is analyzed by comparing the thresholds derived from the various radar rainfall scenarios, using the rainfall estimates obtained from the application of the complete correction algorithm as a reference scenario. Results show that the application of the complete correction algorithm improves significantly the accuracy of radar rainfall estimates: Fractional Standard Error is decreased by 20{\%}, Correlation Coefficient is increased by 24{\%} relative to uncorrected data. Correction for atmospheric attenuation is the most important step in the correction chain. The use of uncorrected radar estimates leads to substantially underestimated thresholds with respect to the reference scenario; adjusting radar data for bias is not sufficient to overcome this problem. Radar rainfall estimates which are corrected but not adjusted with raingauge data are able to provide intensity-duration thresholds which are almost indistinguishable from the reference scenario. The derivation of the radar-based threshold is shown to be very sensitive to spatial location errors of rainfall and debris flows. Raingauge-based thresholds are severely underestimated with respect to the reference scenario. This clearly demonstrates the severity of the raingauge-based estimation problem for the derivation of debris flow triggering rainfall and highlights the benefits of using weather radar observations, at least for the case of short duration convective storms.},

abstract = {This study documents the preferred location and diurnal cycle of extreme convective storms that occur in the tropical band containing the east Pacific Ocean, Central and South America, the Atlantic Ocean, and northern Africa. Data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar show three types of convective-stratiform structures that constitute extreme convective events: deep convective cores (DCCs), wide convective cores (WCCs), and broad stratiform regions (BSRs). Interim ECMWF Re- Analysis (ERA-Interim) data show the associated synoptic environmental factors associated with the oc- currence of extreme convective features. The DCC, WCC, and BSRechoes are associated with early, middle, and late stages of convective system development, respectively, and the statistics and timing of their occur- rence are related to topography and life cycle behavior of the convection. Storms containing DCC occur primarily over the Sudanian savannas of Africa and near the mountains in northern South America, being diurnally controlled. Storms with WCC manifest over land, in the same regions as the DCC, but also over oceanic regions. They appear around the clock but with maximum frequency at night. They are favored in regions of midlevel synoptic-scale low pressure systems, which over the sub-Sahara are the troughs of easterly waves. Storms containing BSR maximize over oceanic regions west of Africa and South America, where they exhibit a weak diurnal cycle with a slight midmorning maximum. Off the west coast of South America, the storms withWCCand BSR have longer lifetimes enhanced by orographic lifting over the Andes. The storms with BSR in the east Pacific Ocean often develop into tropical cyclones. 1.},

abstract = {Satellite infrared data and in situ surface measurements from the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA CORE) are used to examine the diurnal variations of deep convection in two distinct large-scale flow regimes over the western Pacific warm pool. Large-scale atmospheric dynamic and radiative processes strongly affect the life-cycle of deep convective systems in the tropics. the observed diurnal variation of tropical cloud systems suggests that diurnal heating of the tropical atmosphere and ocean surfaces provides favoured conditions in the afternoon for the formation of cloud systems and, as the cloud systems grow and decay with time, the diurnal cycle of cloudiness reflects the life-cycle (initiation, growth, and dissipation) of cloud systems. During the convectively suppressed phases of the intra-seasonal oscillation (ISO), the cloud systems are spatially small and their lifetimes are generally short ({\textless} 3 h). They form, reach maximum size, and die preferentially in the afternoon, at the time of day when the ocean surface and overlying atmospheric surface layer are warmest from solar heating. During the convectively active phases of the ISO, the cold cloud coverage is dominated by spatially large, long-lived cloud systems. They tend to form in the afternoon (1400-1900 lst) and reach a maximum areal extent of very cold cloud tops ({\textless} 208 K) before dawn (0000-0600 lst). As part of their life-cycle, the subsequent decay of these large systems extends into the next day; the satellite-observed maximum cloud coverage is dominated by successively warmer cloud tops, from 208-235 K in the early afternoon (∼ 1400 lst) to 235-260 K in the early evening (∼ 1800 lst). Meanwhile the frequency of small cloud systems exhibits two peaks-one in the afternoon and the other in the predawn hours. the latter is evidently triggered by outflows from the large convective systems. The life-cycle of the large, long-lasting convective systems introduces horizontal variability into the pattern of observed cold cloud tops during the active phases of the ISO. Because the life-cycle of large convective systems can take up to a day, they leave the boundary layer filled with air of lower moist-static energy and a cloud canopy that partially shades the ocean surface from the sunlight the following day. So the day after a major large convective system, the surface conditions do not favour another round of convection; therefore, convection occurs in neighbouring regions unaffected by the previous convective systems. We call this spatially selective behaviour of the large systems diurnal dancing. the boundary-layer recovery phase leads to a tendency for the large systems to occur every other day at a given location. This 2-day periodicity appears to phase-lock with westward-propagating equatorial inertio-gravity waves of similar frequency. the combination of the diurnal surface-cloudradiation interaction and equatorial inertio-gravity waves may explain the observed westward-propagating 2-day disturbances in cold cloud tops over the warm pool.},

abstract = {Afternoon/evening near-coastal convection over land is easily understood as a response to solar heating of the land, turbulent transfer of heat and moisture to the boundary layer, and lifting of air by vigorous sea-breeze fronts. Subtler processes apparently underlie the late night and morning convection that is prevalent over coastal waters throughout the Tropics. Sensitivity tests using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5), and further diagnoses of the control run described in Part II, are used to explore these processes. Prior studies have speculated that “land-breeze” circulations, analogous but opposite to the sea breeze, drive offshore convection at night. However, nighttime radiative cooling of land and the associated thermal breezes are much weaker than the corresponding daytime processes, especially under humid tropical skies. Analysis of model mean soundings reveals that modest (fractions of a degree Celsius) temperature changes near the 800-hPa level change the sign of the buoyancy of low-level air, from negative (inhibited) to positive (convecting) after about midnight in the coastal zone. These diurnal temperature changes are seen to be signatures of a diurnal gravity wave with a propagation speed of ∼15 m s−1, similar to the speed of motion of the diurnal seaward sweep of convection seen in satellite data as well as in the model. This wave radiates from the diurnally oscillating heat source of the daytime mixed layer, raised up into the stratified layers of the atmosphere by elevated terrain. A surprising finding is that the model mean rainfall field is almost the same in a simulation without diurnally varying solar radiation.},

abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

The flights supported rainfall and other hydrometeorological observations (including surface winds) from the Marsyandi network that has been operated in this region since the spring of 1999. The thermodynamic profiles obtained from the soundings support the observed nocturnal maximum in rainfall during the monsoon, with total column moisture and instability maximized just before rainfall peaks.

This section of coastline constitutes a steep, approximately two-dimensional north–south-oriented orographic barrier. The front exhibited a northeast–southwest orientation and thus intersected the axis of high terrain at an acute angle. The along-barrier pressure gradient and low-level winds increased with time along the coastal zone and reached a maximum as the front made landfall.

The Leh flood of 2010 at the edge of the Himalayan Plateau in India is an example of the tragic consequences of such storms. The flood occurred over a high mountain river valley when, on three successive days, diurnally generated convective cells over the Tibetan Plateau gathered into mesoscale convective systems and moved off the edge of the Plateau over Leh. An easterly midlevel jet associated with a midlevel monsoon vortex over northern India and a high over Asia helped the convection organize into propagating mesoscale systems that moved over the edge of the Plateau. On the third day the mesoscale system moving off the plateau was greatly invigorated when it suddenly drew on moisture flowing upslope over the terrain. It gained maximum strength from this intake of moisture near Leh, and the heavy rains washed over the surrounding mountains and down and over the town.},

abstract = {The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River. Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013 and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas. Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling (Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering three different scenarios associated with the initial construction (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population. Specific stage–damage functions were expressly developed using in situ data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit value were established. The relationship between water depth and the height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function. Other nonspecific magnitude–damage functions were used in order to compare both economic estimates. The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude–damage functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses, partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well as the types of flood that affect it.},

@article{Lin2001,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to synthesize some common synoptic and mesoscale environments conducive to heavy orographic rainfall. Previous studies of U.S. and Alpine cases and new analyses of some Alpine and east Asian cases have shown the following common synoptic and mesoscale environments are conducive to heavy orographic rainfall: 1) a conditionally or potentially unstable airstream impinging on the mountains, 2) a very moist low-level jet (LLJ), 3) a steep mountain, and 4) a quasi-stationary synoptic system to slow the convective system over the threat area. A deep short-wave trough is found to approach the threat area in the U.S. and European cases, but is not found in the east Asian cases. On the other hand, a high convective available potential energy (CAPE) value is observed in east Asian cases, but is not consistently observed in the U.S. and European cases. The enhancement of low-level upward motion and the increase of instability below the trough by the approaching deep short-wave trough in the U.S. and Alpine events may partially compensate the roles played by high CAPE in the East Asian events. In addition, the concave mountain geometry plays an important role in helping trigger the convection in Alpine and Taiwanese cases.Based on an ingredient argument, it is found that a heavy orographic rainfall requires significant contributions from any combinations of the above four common synoptic and mesoscale environments or ingredients, and high precipitation efficiency of the incoming airstream, strong upward motion, and large convective system. These ingredients are also used to help explain the synoptic and mesoscale environments observed in some orographic flooding and heavy rainfall events in other regions, such as in New Zealand, China, and India. An index, U(parthsolpartx)q, where U is the flow velocity perpendicular to the mountain range, parthsolpartx the mountain slope, and q the water vapor mixing ratio, is also proposed to help predict the occurrence of heavy orographic rainfall. Estimates of this proposed index indicate that it may serve as a good indicator for predicting east Asian heavy orographic rainfall events.},

This characterization of high-impact weather in South America provides crucial information for socioeconomic implications and public safety.},

abstract = {A cutoff low (COL) pressure system that occurred in March 2005 (late austral summer) over the subtropical southeast Pacific is examined by means of numerical simulations using the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model. The episode exhibited typical features of COLs in this region, including its formation from an elongated northwest-southeast extratropical trough and subsequent intensification off the west coast of South America. During the developing stage, the cyclonic circulation did not extend into the lower troposphere and only upper-level, nonprecipitating clouds were observed at and around the system. When the COL reached the continent it produced moderate but unseasonal rainfall along the semiarid western slope of the Andes cordillera [summit level at similar to 5000 m above sea level (ASL)] at the same time that the system experienced a rapid decay. The control simulation used full physics, full topography, and a single domain (54-km grid spacing) laterally forced by atmospheric reanalysis. Model results are in general agreement with upper-air, surface, and satellite observations, and allow a detailed description of the three-dimensional structure of the COL, as well as an evaluation of the vorticity and temperature budgets. A quasi-stationary, amplifying warm ridge over the South Pacific appears as the key precursor feature, in agreement with studies elsewhere. Once the COL formed, it drifted eastward mostly driven by vorticity advection induced by its own circulation, and there was close balance between vertical and horizontal temperature advection near its center. The jet streak along the COL's periphery migrated from upstream of the COL axis, during the developing stage, to downstream later on. Four sensitivity experiments-reducing/removing topography, suppressing hydrometeors, and using an enlarged domain-were performed to assess the influence of the Andes, the importance of latent heat release, and the effect of the boundary conditions. Comparison among the control and sensitivity runs indicates that the COL formation occurs regardless of the presence of the Andes, and COL dissipation is mainly due to latent beat released in the deep clouds that form over the mountainous terrain. Nevertheless, the Andes cordillera delayed the COL demise by blocking the inflow of warm, moist air from the interior of the continent that otherwise would initiate deep convection in the region of ascending motion downstream of the COL.},

@article{Barrett2009a,
abstract = {The effects of the Andes Cordillera, the major mountain range in South America, on precipitation patterns of baroclinic systems approaching from the southeast Pacific remain largely unstudied. This study focuses on a case in late May 2008 when an upper-level trough and surface cold front produced widespread precipitation in central Chile. The primary goal was to analyze the physical mechanisms responsible for the structure and evolution of the precipitation. Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations indicate that as an upper-level trough approached central Chile, midtropospheric flow below 700 hPa was blocked by the high topography and deflected poleward in the form of a barrier jet. This northerly jet had wind maxima in excess of 15 m s(-1), was centered around 925 hPa, and extended westward 200 km from the mountains. It intersected the cold front, which approached from the south near the coast, thereby increasing convergence along the frontal surface, slowing its equatorward progress, and enhancing rainfall over central Chile. Another separate region of heavy precipitation formed over the upwind slopes of the cordillera. A trajectory analysis confirmed that the barrier jet moved low-level parcels from their origin in the moist southeast Pacific boundary layer to the coast. When model topography was reduced to twenty percent of its original height, the cold front advanced more rapidly to the northeast, generated less precipitation in central Chile between 33 degrees and 36 degrees S, and produced minimal orographic precipitation on the upwind Andean slopes. Based on these findings, the high topography appears responsible for not only orographic precipitation but also for substantially increasing precipitation totals over the central coast and valley.},

@article{Buzzi1998,
abstract = {The intense precipitation event that occurred between 3 and 6 November 1994 and caused extensive flooding over Piedmont in northwestern Italy is simulated and tested with respect to various physical aspects, using a meteorological mesoscale model (BOLAM). The period when the most intense rain occurred, mainly covering the second half of 4 and all of 5 November, is examined. A control experiment, starting at 1200 UTC 4 November, simulates the two observed precipitation peaks and captures the magnitude and timing of the most intense precipitation well even at relatively low horizontal resolution (about 30 km). The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses are used to provide the initial and boundary conditions. Model output diagnostics and comparison with observations indicate that most of the precipitation is associated with a prefrontal low-level jet, ahead of the cold front, impinging upon the orography of the region (Alps and Apennines). The model simulates a multiple rainband and frontal structure whose evolution determines both intensity and location of the prefrontal warm and moist flow. Almost all of the simulated precipitation over the Alps forms in the middle–low troposphere through forced ascent, whereas part of the secondary maximum, observed over the Apennines, is of convective type. Sensitivity experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of orography, surface fluxes, and latent heat exchange processes in the atmosphere. The role of the orography is crucial in determining distribution and amount of precipitation, whereas sensible and latent heat fluxes from the Mediterranean Sea (over the period considered) enhanced only the convective precipitation. Distinct dynamical effects, important for the amount and the spatial distribution of precipitation, are found to be associated with warming due to condensation and cooling due to evaporation and melting of precipitation. The latter process seems to be responsible for the simulated formation of rainbands and complex evolution of the cold front over the western Mediterranean. The multiple front life cycle and propagation feeds back on the simulated precipitation distribution, affecting the location of the prefrontal moist flow. Condensation affects the atmospheric effective stratification where the flow impinges on the orography, determining the flow regime (orographic lifting vs blocking and flow around), which, in turn, has an important impact on precipitation.},

abstract = {Flash floods cause some of the most severe natural disasters in Europe but Mediterranean areas are especially vulnerable. They can cause devastating damage to property, infrastructures and loss of human life. The complexity of flash flood generation processes and their dependency on different factors related to watershed properties and rainfall characteristics make flash flood prediction a difficult task. In this study, as part of the EU-FLASH project, we used an uncalibrated hydrological model to simulate flow events in a 27km2 Mediterranean watershed in Israel to analyze and better understand the various factors influencing flows. The model is based on the well-known SCS curve number method for rainfall-runoff calculations and on the kinematic wave method for flow routing. Existing data available from maps, GIS and field studies were used to define model parameters, and no further calibration was conducted to obtain a better fit between computed and observed flow data. The model rainfall input was obtained from the high temporal and spatial resolution radar data adjusted to rain gauges. Twenty flow events that occurred within the study area over a 15year period were analyzed. The model shows a generally good capability in predicting flash flood peak discharge in terms of their general level, classified as low, medium or high (all high level events were correctly predicted). It was found that the model mainly well predicts flash floods generated by intense, short-lived convective storm events while model performances for low and moderate flows generated by more widespread winter storms were quite poor. The degree of urban development was found to have a large impact on runoff amount and peak discharge, with higher sensitivity of moderate and low flow events relative to high flows. Flash flood generation was also found to be very sensitive to the temporal distribution of rain intensity within a specific storm event. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Barros2004a,
abstract = {The linkages between the space-time variability of observed clouds, rainfall, large-circulation patterns and topography in northern India and the Himalayas were investigated using remote sensing data. The research purpose was to test the hypothesis that cloudiness patterns are dynamic tracers of rainstorms, and therefore their temporal and spatial evolution can be used as a proxy of the spatial and temporal organization of precipitation and precipitation processes in the Himalayan range during the monsoon. The results suggest that the space-time distribution of precipitation, the spatial variability of the diurnal cycle of convective activity, and the terrain (landform and altitudinal gradients) are intertwined at spatial scales ranging from the order of a few kms (1-5 km) up to the continental-scale. Furthermore, this relationship is equally strong in the time domain with respect to the onset and intra-seasonal variability of the monsoon. Infrared and microwave imagery of cloud fields were analyzed to characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of mesoscale convective weather systems and short-lived convection in Northern India, the Himalayan range, and in the Tibetan Plateau during three monsoon seasons (1999, 2000 and 2001). The life cycle of convective systems suggests landform and orographic controls consistent with a convergence zone constrained to the valley of the Ganges and the Himalayan range, bounded in the west by the Aravalli range and the Garhwal mountains and in the East by the Khasi Hills and the Bay of Bengal, which we call the Northern India Convergence Zone (NICZ). The NICZ exhibits strong nighttime activity along the south-facing slopes of the Himalayan range, which is characterized by the development of shortlived convection (1-3 h) aligned with protruding ridges between 1:00 and 3:00 AM. The intra-annual and inter-annual variability of convective activity in the NICZ were assessed with respect to large-scale synoptic conditions, monsoon activity in the Bay of Bengal, and the modulating role of orography. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and canonical correlation (CC) analysis suggest that joint modes of variability of monsoon weather and topography, which we call orographic land-atmosphere interactions, modulate the space-time variability of cloudiness in the region. Finally, scaling analysis of cloudiness suggests three different scaling regimes of orographic land-atmosphere interactions: 1) a synoptic-scale regime (greater than or equal to70-80km); 2) an orographic meso-beta regime (30-70 km) associated with the succession of wide valleys and bulky terrain features; and 3) an orographic meso-a regime (less than or equal to30 km) associated with the complex succession of protruding south-facing ridges and narrow valleys that characterize the Himalayan foothills between altitudes of 3 000 and 5 000 m elevations.},

abstract = {This study characterizes mountain waves and orographic precipitation associated with a winter storm passing over the ∼3.5 km above mean sea level (MSL) Park Range of northern Colorado on 15 December 2010. Observations from an airborne vertically pointing Doppler radar are used to document reflectivity and horizontal and vertical velocity in 13 two-dimensional vertical planes extending across the Park Range from upstream of the windward slope, over the crest and downstream of the lee slope. The winter storm investigated in this study is associated with a general zonal flow over the western continental USA and significant vertical wind shear between 700 and 500 hPa. A vertically propagating wave forced by the Park Range is most evident above 4 km MSL and associated with relatively wide, upstream-tilted updraughts and downdraughts located above the Park Range windward and lee slopes, respectively. The Park Range also forces a trapped lee wave that manifests itself as a relatively erect updraught ∼15-20 km east of the crest. Smaller-scale trapped lee waves forced by terrain upstream of the Park Range are evident below 4 km MSL and associated with rotor circulations composed of relatively narrow updraughts and downdraughts located above the Yampa Valley and the Park Range windward slope. A ∼1 km thick layer of strong vertical shear exists between the mountain waves forced by the Park Range and those forced by upstream terrain. This shear layer exhibits a large vertical displacement over the Park Range, with relatively strong westerly winds plunging to low levels over the lee slope. While precipitation on the Park Range windward slope is generally enhanced for the event, data analysed for this case surprisingly does not show a spatially and temporally consistent correlation between mountain-wave kinematic structures and orographic precipitation. Transient processes such as wave-regime interactions may have masked this correlation. {\textcopyright} 2016 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to synthesize some common synoptic and mesoscale environments conducive to heavy orographic rainfall. Previous studies of U.S. and Alpine cases and new analyses of some Alpine and east Asian cases have shown the following common synoptic and mesoscale environments are conducive to heavy orographic rainfall: 1) a conditionally or potentially unstable airstream impinging on the mountains, 2) a very moist low-level jet (LLJ), 3) a steep mountain, and 4) a quasi-stationary synoptic system to slow the convective system over the threat area. A deep short-wave trough is found to approach the threat area in the U.S. and European cases, but is not found in the east Asian cases. On the other hand, a high convective available potential energy (CAPE) value is observed in east Asian cases, but is not consistently observed in the U.S. and European cases. The enhancement of low-level upward motion and the increase of instability below the trough by the approaching deep short-wave trough in the U.S. and Alpine events may partially compensate the roles played by high CAPE in the East Asian events. In addition, the concave mountain geometry plays an important role in helping trigger the convection in Alpine and Taiwanese cases.Based on an ingredient argument, it is found that a heavy orographic rainfall requires significant contributions from any combinations of the above four common synoptic and mesoscale environments or ingredients, and high precipitation efficiency of the incoming airstream, strong upward motion, and large convective system. These ingredients are also used to help explain the synoptic and mesoscale environments observed in some orographic flooding and heavy rainfall events in other regions, such as in New Zealand, China, and India. An index, U(parthsolpartx)q, where U is the flow velocity perpendicular to the mountain range, parthsolpartx the mountain slope, and q the water vapor mixing ratio, is also proposed to help predict the occurrence of heavy orographic rainfall.

abstract = {Flash floods on the edge of high terrain, such as the Himalayas or Rocky Mountains, are especially dangerous and hard to predict. The Leh flood of 2010 at the edge of the Himalayan Plateau in India is an example of the tragic consequences of such storms. The flood occurred over a high mountain river valley when, on three successive days, diurnally generated convective cells over the Tibetan Plateau gathered into mesoscale convective systems and moved off the edge of the Plateau over Leh. An easterly midlevel jet associated with a midlevel monsoon vortex over northern India and a high over Asia helped the convection organize into propagating mesoscale systems that moved over the edge of the Plateau. On the third day the mesoscale system moving off the plateau was greatly invigorated when it suddenly drew on moisture flowing upslope over the terrain. It gained maximum strength from this intake of moisture near Leh, and the heavy rains washed over the surrounding mountains and down and over the town.},

Because of the strong spatial and temporal variability of precipitation, estimation of spatially distributed rain rates is challenging. Despite the fact that weather radars provide high-resolution (but indirect) observations of precipitation, they are not used in hydrological applications as extensively as one could expect. The goal of the present review paper is to investigate this question and to provide a clear view of the opportunities (e.g., for flash floods, urban hydrology, rainfall spatial extremes) the limitations (e.g., complicated error structure, need for adjustment) and the challenges for the use of weather radar in hydrology (i.e., validation studies, precipitation forecasting, mountainous precipitation, error propagation in hydrological models). ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A cutoff low (COL) pressure system that occurred in March 2005 (late austral summer) over the subtropical southeast Pacific is examined by means of numerical simulations using the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model. The episode exhibited typical features of COLs in this region, including its formation from an elongated northwest-southeast extratropical trough and subsequent intensification off the west coast of South America. During the developing stage, the cyclonic circulation did not extend into the lower troposphere and only upper-level, nonprecipitating clouds were observed at and around the system. When the COL reached the continent it produced moderate but unseasonal rainfall along the semiarid western slope of the Andes cordillera [summit level at similar to 5000 m above sea level (ASL)] at the same time that the system experienced a rapid decay. The control simulation used full physics, full topography, and a single domain (54-km grid spacing) laterally forced by atmospheric reanalysis. Model results are in general agreement with upper-air, surface, and satellite observations, and allow a detailed description of the three-dimensional structure of the COL, as well as an evaluation of the vorticity and temperature budgets. A quasi-stationary, amplifying warm ridge over the South Pacific appears as the key precursor feature, in agreement with studies elsewhere. Once the COL formed, it drifted eastward mostly driven by vorticity advection induced by its own circulation, and there was close balance between vertical and horizontal temperature advection near its center. The jet streak along the COL's periphery migrated from upstream of the COL axis, during the developing stage, to downstream later on. Four sensitivity experiments-reducing/removing topography, suppressing hydrometeors, and using an enlarged domain-were performed to assess the influence of the Andes, the importance of latent heat release, and the effect of the boundary conditions. Comparison among the control and sensitivity runs indicates that the COL formation occurs regardless of the presence of the Andes, and COL dissipation is mainly due to latent beat released in the deep clouds that form over the mountainous terrain. Nevertheless, the Andes cordillera delayed the COL demise by blocking the inflow of warm, moist air from the interior of the continent that otherwise would initiate deep convection in the region of ascending motion downstream of the COL.},

The physical mechanisms involved comprise a rich set of interactions encompassing fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and micron-scale cloud processes, as well as being dependent on the larger-scale patterns of the atmo-spheric general circulation. Investigations into orographic precipitation have pursued three parallel tracks of inquiry: observations, theory, and modeling. Significant ad-vances have been made in each over the last few decades, and these are summarized and synthesized here. While many aspects of the basic mechanisms responsible for orographic precipitation have been understood, important issues remain unresolved. The sheer number of contributing processes, together with their convoluted interac-tions, make the quantitative prediction of precipitation in complex terrain a very hard task. However, while prediction of precipitation amounts for any given event may be difficult, various lines of evidence suggest that the patterns of orgraphic precipitation, even on scales of a few kilometers, are much more robust.},

Tests on one month of data from one site show that the algorithms perform accurately and provide products that characterize the essential features of the precipitation climatology. Input to the algorithms are the operationally executed volume scans of a radar and the data from a surrounding rain gauge network. The algorithms separate the radar echoes into convective and stratiform regions, statistically summarize the vertical structure of the radar echoes, and determine precipitation rates and amounts on high spatial resolution. The convective and stratiform regions are separated on the basis of the intensity and sharpness of the peaks of echo intensity. The peaks indicate the centers of the convective region. Precipitation not identified as convective is stratiform. This method avoids the problem of underestimating the stratiform precipitation. The separation criteria are...},

abstract = {The 2 June 2008 flood-producing storm on the Starzel river basin in South-West Germany is examined as a prototype for organized convective systems that dominate the upper tail of the precipitation frequency distribution and are likely responsible for the flash flood peaks in Central Europe. The availability of high-resolution rainfall estimates from radar observations and a rain gauge network, together with indirect peak discharge estimates from a detailed post-event survey, provided the opportunity to study in detail the hydrometeorological and hydrological mechanisms associated with this extreme storm and the ensuing flood. Radar-derived rainfall, streamgauge data and indirect estimates of peak discharges are used along with a distributed hydrologic model to reconstruct hydrographs at multiple locations. Observations and model results are combined to examine two main questions, (i) assessment of the distribution of the runoff ratio for the 2008 flash flood and how it compares with other less severe floods; and (ii) analysis of how the spatial and temporal distribution of the extreme rainfall, and more specifically storm motion, controls the flood response. It is shown that small runoff ratios (less than 20{\%}) characterized the runoff response and that these values are in the range of other, less extreme, flood events. The influence of storm structure, evolution and motion on the modeled flood hydrograph is examined by using the "spatial moments of catchment rainfall". It is shown that downbasin storm motion (in the range of 0.7-0.9 m s(-1)) had a noticeable impact on flood response by increasing the modeled flood peak by 13 {\%}.},

abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

abstract = {AbstractSatellite radar and radiometer data indicate that subtropical South America has some of the deepest and most extreme convective storms on Earth. This study uses the full 15-yr TRMM Precipitation Radar dataset in conjunction with high-resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to better understand the physical factors that control the climatology of high-impact weather in subtropical South America. The occurrence of intense storms with an extreme horizontal dimension is generally associated with lee cyclogenesis and a strengthening South American low-level jet (SALLJ) in the La Plata basin. The orography of the Andes is critical, and model sensitivity calculations removing and/or reducing various topographic features indicate the orographic control on the initiation of convection and its upscale growth into mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Reduced Andes experiments show more widespread convective initiation, weaker average storm intensity, and more rapid propagation of the MCS to the east (reminiscent of the MCS life cycle downstream of lower mountains such as the Rockies). With reduced Andes, lee cyclogenesis and SALLJ winds are weaker, while they are stronger in increased Andes runs. The presence of the Sierras de C{\'{o}}rdoba (secondary mountain range east of the Andes in Argentina) focuses convective initiation and results in more intense storms in experiments with higher Andes. Average CAPE and CIN values for each terrain modification simulation show that reduced Andes runs had lower CIN and CAPE, while increased Andes runs had both stronger CAPE and CIN. From this research, a conceptual model for convective storm environments leading to convective initiation has been developed for subtropical South America.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential relationship between flash flood events and convective precipitation in Catalonia, as well as any related trends. The paper starts with an overview of flash floods and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of, and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996???2011) but more extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation. Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective contribution to rainfall, introducing the ?? parameter as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as a multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events. The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values of precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain this positive trend in flash flood events. The ?? parameter has been also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short and local events, usually with daily ?? values above 0.5, while the minimum threshold of daily ?? for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.},

abstract = {The effects of the Andes Cordillera, the major mountain range in South America, on precipitation patterns of baroclinic systems approaching from the southeast Pacific remain largely unstudied. This study focuses on a case in late May 2008 when an upper-level trough and surface cold front produced widespread precipitation in central Chile. The primary goal was to analyze the physical mechanisms responsible for the structure and evolution of the precipitation. Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations indicate that as an upper-level trough approached central Chile, midtropospheric flow below 700 hPa was blocked by the high topography and deflected poleward in the form of a barrier jet. This northerly jet had wind maxima in excess of 15 m s(-1), was centered around 925 hPa, and extended westward 200 km from the mountains. It intersected the cold front, which approached from the south near the coast, thereby increasing convergence along the frontal surface, slowing its equatorward progress, and enhancing rainfall over central Chile. Another separate region of heavy precipitation formed over the upwind slopes of the cordillera. A trajectory analysis confirmed that the barrier jet moved low-level parcels from their origin in the moist southeast Pacific boundary layer to the coast. When model topography was reduced to twenty percent of its original height, the cold front advanced more rapidly to the northeast, generated less precipitation in central Chile between 33 degrees and 36 degrees S, and produced minimal orographic precipitation on the upwind Andean slopes. Based on these findings, the high topography appears responsible for not only orographic precipitation but also for substantially increasing precipitation totals over the central coast and valley.},

In an attempt to overcome this problem we have combined archival records, dendrogeomorphic time series and instrumental data (daily rainfall and discharge) from four ungauged and poorly gauged mountain basins in Central Spain with the aim of reconstructing and compiling information on 41 flash flood events since the end of the 19th century. Estimation of historical discharge and the incorporation of uncertainty for the at-site and regional flood frequency analysis were performed with an empirical rainfall-runoff assessment as well as stochastic and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. Results for each of the ungauged basins include flood frequency, severity, seasonality and triggers (synoptic meteorological situations). The reconstructed data series clearly demonstrates how uncertainty can be reduced by including historical information, but also points to the considerable influence of different approaches on quantile estimation. This uncertainty should be taken into account when these data are used for flood risk management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

As is typical of flash floods along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, rapidly rising streamflow proceeded to move downhill (eastward) into Calgary.A meteorological analysis traces an antecedent Rossby wave train across the North Pacific Ocean, starting with intense baroclinic development over East Asia on 11 June. Subsequently, downstream Rossby wave development occurred across the North Pacific; a 1032-hPa subtropical anticyclone located northeast of Hawaii initiated a southerly atmospheric river into Alaska, which contributed to the development of a cutoff anticyclone over Alaska and a Rex block (ridge to the north, cyclone to the south) in...},

abstract = {Mountains, through atmospheric processes, play an integrated role in weather systems and climate systems. In turn, weather and climate over and nearby mountains are modified depending on environmental conditions. Mountain size, shape, slope, aspect ratio, and orientation along the water sources affect the weather systems; they can intensify fronts, eddies, vortex, rotors and turbulence, visibility, and precipitation. Depending on their location and height, precipitation type as snow over the mountains contributes significantly to hydrometeorological cycle and ecosystem. Increasing temperatures because of a possible climate change can reduce river discharges during warm seasons. Therefore, accurate measurements of climate change impact on the mountains are required. On the other hand, obtaining measurements over the mountainous regions are extremely difficult because of strong winds, cold temperatures ({\textless}0??C), mountain slopes, and heavy snow precipitation as well as instrumental issues. New developments on measurement strategies and instruments, and developing multiscale numerical models with detailed cloud microphysical processes and boundary layer parameterizations can reduce uncertainties in the weather and climate prediction.

abstract = {Ephemeral streams are typical Mediterranean fluvial systems with high risk of flash flooding, and few data are available about these systems in most locales. However, the SAIH network (Automatic Hydrological Information Systems) of the Jucar River Water Authority has been providing detailed information about ephemeral streams in Spain every 5min since 1988. Using these data, we evaluated the processes of rainfall-runoff conversion and flood generation in five Mediterranean ephemeral streams ranging in size from 25 to 450km2. To provide a general framework for hydrological analysis, the study included 142 flash flood events registered between 1989 and 2007. A more detailed analysis was conducted for the Carraixet Basin under the dry antecedent moisture condition (AMC I) to evaluate the influence of rainfall on the basin's response. A simple index called Momentum of Maximum Intensity (MMI) was developed to describe the influence of rainfall intensity on hydrograph. Correlations between the main indicators of precipitation and flow also were assessed. Results showed that flash floods were generally generated by average accumulated rainfall of around 100mm at high intensities that could exceed 300mm/h. Initial abstractions and average water losses during the rainfall-runoff conversion processes were very important (runoff coefficients of 6{\%} and runoff thresholds of 62mm). No correlation was found between initial abstractions (Ia ) calculated from the basin characteristics and runoff thresholds (P 0) empirically obtained, which create some doubts about the validity of Ia method for predicting floods in ephemeral streams. Accumulated rainfall was very important for flood volume, peak flow and water balance indicators, whereas intensity indicators were more related to the response times of the basins. Rainfall intensity variables influenced lag time. Accumulated rainfall, in combination with high reduced mean intensity and low persistence, were a good predictor for high peak flow. Finally, the analysis revealed two types of events. The first type, typical of summer and early autumn, consists of fast events characterized by intense rainfall concentrated at the beginning of the storm and high values of persistence and irregularity. The basin responds quickly and generates hydrographs that resemble the pattern of rain. The second type, representative of winter and spring, corresponds to less intense events. Although they accumulate more rain, maximum intensities are lower and occur at the end of the episode. The response of the basin is late, and hydrographs are quite different from hyetographs and very influenced by the basin.},

abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

abstract = {This paper presents a detailed analysis of the September 8-9, 2002 flash flood event in the Gard region (southern France) using two distributed hydrological models: CVN built within the LIQUID{\textregistered} hydrological platform and MARINE. The models differ in terms of spatial discretization, infiltration and water redistribution representation, and river flow transfer. MARINE can also account for subsurface lateral flow. Both models are set up using the same available information, namely a DEM and a pedology map. They are forced with high resolution radar rainfall data over a set of 18 sub-catchments ranging from 2.5 to 99km2 and are run without calibration. To begin with, models simulations are assessed against post field estimates of the time of peak and the maximum peak discharge showing a fair agreement for both models. The results are then discussed in terms of flow dynamics, runoff coefficients and soil saturation dynamics. The contribution of the subsurface lateral flow is also quantified using the MARINE model. This analysis highlights that rainfall remains the first controlling factor of flash flood dynamics. High rainfall peak intensities are very influential of the maximum peak discharge for both models, but especially for the CVN model which has a simplified overland flow transfer. The river bed roughness also influences the peak intensity and time. Soil spatial representation is shown to have a significant role on runoff coefficients and on the spatial variability of saturation dynamics. Simulated soil saturation is found to be strongly related with soil depth and initial storage deficit maps, due to a full saturation of most of the area at the end of the event. When activated, the signature of subsurface lateral flow is also visible in the spatial patterns of soil saturation with higher values concentrating along the river network. However, the data currently available do not allow the assessment of both patterns. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for enhancing field observations in order to progress in process understanding and gather a larger set of data to improve the realism of distributed models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Suburban areas undergo rapid land-use changes due to urban growth. Consequently, the mitigation of hydrological impacts is a major issue in the field of flood and water pollution management. Nevertheless, suburban catchments have seldom been studied. This paper presents a method for analyzing the hydrological behaviour of suburban catchments; the particular method is tested on the Ch{\'{e}}zine catchment, located in a suburban area of Nantes (western France). Ch{\'{e}}zine provides a typical example of a suburban catchment, yet features the unique behaviour of a response time ranging from 1 to 6h. It is proposed herein to classify rainfall-runoff events in homogeneous groups according to their flow coefficient. A group of events is characterized by its mean flow coefficient and by its transfer function, which are considered as the signatures of the hydrological behaviour of these similar events. The transfer function is identified from the available series of rainfall and outflow data. The identified transfer functions serve to estimate the localization of contributing zones over the basin by estimating the basin transfer function from flowpaths. The consistency of these assumptions is then verified by comparing the estimated transfer function with the identified one. The application of this method to the Ch{\'{e}}zine catchment demonstrates that it is possible to distinguish various types of hydrological behaviour regimes associated with significantly different transfer functions. The joint analysis of the flow coefficient and transfer function of each group confirms that the Ch{\'{e}}zine catchment reacts like an urban basin with just the urban zones contributing to runoff under dry conditions. Otherwise, the wetter the initial state, the greater the tendency of this basin to react like a natural basin, as reflected by the different transfer function shapes. These results confirm the validity of the proposed method to analyse the various behaviour regimes of suburban catchments. In addition, this method helps define the specifications of hydrological models suited to suburban catchments.},

In the current study, we present an innovative approach to exploit spatial rainfall information of air mass thunderstorms and link it with a watershed hydrological model. Observed radar data are decomposed into sets of rain cells conceptualized as circular Gaussian elements and the associated rain cell parameters, namely, location, maximal intensity and decay factor, are input into a hydrological model. Rain cells were retrieved from radar data for several thunderstorms over southern Arizona. Spatial characteristics of the resulting rain fields were evaluated using data from a dense rain gauge network. For an extreme case study in a semi-arid watershed, rain cells were derived and fed as input into a hydrological model to compute runoff response. A major factor in this event was found to be a single intense rain cell (out of the five cells decomposed from the storm). The path of this cell near watershed tributaries and toward the outlet enhanced generation of high flow. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis to cell characteristics indicated that peak discharge could be a factor of two higher if the cell was initiated just a few kilometers aside. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

An overview of the invited contributions follows, which includes a subjective explanation for the conceptual thread that joins them. Key to the contents of the invited papers is the future role of hydrology within the geosciences. Such a role is argued to be of growing importance owing, on one side, to the objective social and economic relevance of hydrologic matters (a fair distribution of water resources, flood and droughts among them) and, on the other, to the quality and the spatial/temporal extent of hydrologic data, which have been indeed instrumental in the radical change we recently experienced in the way we perceive and measure natural phenomena. },

The box-counting approach is one of the frequently used techniques to estimate the FD of an image. This paper presents an efficient box-counting-based method for the improvement of FD estimation accuracy. A new model is proposed to assign the smallest number of boxes to cover the entire image surface at each selected scale as required, thereby yielding more accurate estimates. The experiments using synthesized fractional Brownian motion images, real texture images, and remote sensing images demonstrate this new method can outperform the well-known differential boxing-counting (DBC) method. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling has become an essential step in the scientific interpretation of model results and a useful tool to support decision making. Among many uncertainty sources in the modeling practice, uncertainties in precipitation estimation play an important role since it is the main driving force for other hydrological processes. The present study demonstrates a statistical method for generating radar rainfall realizations that account for the uncertainties in radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). The random sampling technique used to generate stochastic uncertainty fields is based on sequential Gaussian simulation. The hydrological impact of the uncertainties in radar QPE is analyzed by propagating the rainfall ensemble through a distributed and integrated water resources model. The study shows that the uncertainty of the simulated stream discharge depends on the intensity of the rainfall input signal. The coefficient of variation is calculated for simulated stream discharge and groundwater recharge at subcatchments with various sizes. The results reveal strong scale dependency showing higher variations of hydrological uncertainties at smaller catchments, especially for catchment areas smaller than 50 km2. The uncertainties from precipitation input are generally amplified in the hydrological model. This effect is less obvious for groundwater recharge but rather substantial for stream discharge, where the coefficient of variation increases by a factor of three.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to analyse the impact of errors in radar rainfall estimates on rainfall-runoff modelling. This issue is addressed through application of radar rainfall estimates for continuous, lumped rainfall-runoff modelling of the Brue catchment, a mid-sized basin in South-West England, over a two and a half-year period. The study is focused on radar rainfall errors associated with range-related bias due to the vertical profile of reflectivity and with mean-field bias due to systematic errors in the radar calibration and biased reflectivity-to-rainrate relationship. Streamflow is simulated through a conceptual hydrological model based on mean areal rainfall estimates obtained by using various radar rainfall processing scenarios. These simulations are evaluated and compared with corresponding streamflow simulations from a dense raingauge network. The comparisons show that radar errors may preclude the use of unadjusted radar estimates for runoff modelling. Radar rainfall adjustment significantly improves model results with simulation efficiency increasing up to 30{\%} after adjustment. Comparison of radar-driven simulations with observed discharge data reveals a simulation efficiency of 0.75 for the lowest radar scan (adjusted), whereas simulation efficiencies are lower for higher radar scans. The results reveal the critical importance of using radar rainfall estimates as close as possible to the ground and the considerable impact that effects of vertical variability of reflectivity have on runoff simulation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In urban areas, hydrological processes are characterised by high variability in space and time, making them sensitive to small-scale temporal and spatial rainfall variability. In the last decades new instruments, techniques and methods have been developed to capture rainfall and hydrological processes at high resolution. Weather radars have been introduced to estimate high spatial and temporal rainfall variability. At the same time, new models have been proposed to reproduce hydrological response, based on small-scale representation of urban catchment spatial variability. Despite these efforts, interaction between input variability and model resolution remains poorly understood, and further investigations are needed. This paper presents a review of our current understanding of hydrological processes in urban environments as reported in the literature, focusing on their spatial and temporal variability. We review recent findings on the effects of rainfall variability on hydrological response and identify gaps where knowledge need to be further developed to improve our understanding of and capability to predict urban hydrological response.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Extreme rainfall events are of particular importance due to their severe impacts on the economy, the environment and the society. Characterization and quantification of extremes and their spatial dependence structure may lead to a better understanding of extreme events. An important concept in statistical modeling is the tail dependence coefficient (TDC) that describes the degree of association between concurrent rainfall extremes at different locations. Accurate knowledge of the spatial characteristics of the TDC can help improve on the existing models of the occurrence probability of extreme storms. In this study, efficient estimation of the TDC in rainfall is investigated using a dense network of rain gauges located in south Louisiana, USA. The inter-gauge distances in this network range from about 1. km to 9. km. Four different nonparametric TDC estimators are implemented on samples of the rain gauge data and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Three averaging time-scales are considered: 1. h, 2. h and 3. h. The results indicate that a significant tail dependency may exist that cannot be ignored for realistic modeling of multivariate rainfall fields. Presence of a strong dependence among extremes contradicts with the assumption of joint normality, commonly used in hydrologic applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Rain gauge data are often employed to estimate the rainfall depth for a given return period. However, the number of rain gauge records of short-duration rainfall, such as 15 min, is sparse. The obvious advantage of radar data over most rain gauge networks is their higher temporal and spatial resolution. Furthermore, the current quality of quantitative precipitation estimation with radar and the length of the available time series make it feasible to calculate radar-based extreme rainfall statistics. In this paper an 11-year radar data set of precipitation depths for durations of 15 min to 24 h is derived for the Netherlands (3.55 × 104 km2). The radar data are adjusted using rain gauges by combining an hourly mean-field bias adjustment with a daily spatial adjustment. Assuming a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, the index flood method is used to describe the distribution of the annual radar rainfall maxima. Regional variability in the GEV location parameter is studied. GEV parameters based on radar and rain gauge data are compared and turn out to be in reasonable agreement. Furthermore, radar rainfall depth-duration-frequency (DDF) curves and their uncertainties are derived and compared with those based on rain gauge data. Although uncertainties become large for long durations, it is shown that radar data are suitable to construct DDF curves.},

abstract = {The recent deployment of the NEXRAD (WSR-88D) radars in the United States has made spatially distributed rainfall data available in an operational environment. In addition, national databases now exist with high-resolution digital terrain-elevation, soils, and land-use and land-cover data. The availability of such spatially distributed data brings into focus the question of the utility of hydrologic models with spatially distributed parameters and input in an operational environment. Are the data and models accurate and reliable enough to allow their use in an operational environment? The present study discusses a methodology for addressing this issue based on a sensitivity analysis of event streamflow to parameter and radar input within a Monte Carlo framework for the Illinois River basin in Oklahoma and Arkansas. This framework allows the incorporation of parametric and radar-rainfall uncertainties in the analysis and illustrates their effects on the results of the sensitivity. The particular distributed model used incorporates components that are adaptations of operational models used often in a spatially-lumped manner to produce estimates of soil water, runoff and streamflow in watersheds with an area of order 103 km2. A GIS is used to sub-divide the study watershed into small sub-catchment units with areas of a few hundred square kilometers. Soil water accounting and channel routing models are used to generate runoff and streamflow over the network of sub-catchments and streams. Spatially-distributed soil databases are used to condition relevant soil-water model parameters to reflect the soil field capacity. The main conclusions are that: (a) the distributed model forced by NEXRAD data produces results comparable to those produced by the operational spatially-lumped models using raingauge data; (b) sensitivity of flow statistics on various spatial scales to parameters and radar-rainfall input that are uncertain is scale dependent; and (c) in view of parametric and input uncertainty, in several cases, a spatially lumped model has response that cannot be statistically distinguished from that of the distributed model. This study is an initial step toward understanding the issues surrounding the use of distributed models in an operational environment. Repeating the sensitivity analysis for other areas with different geomorphologic, soils and climate characteristics is necessary to investigate aspects pertaining to higher variability in soils and terrain elevation, and the presence of snow accumulation and melt. Sensitivity analysis of soil water estimates to parameters and radar rainfall input is also a natural extension of this work. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Radar-derived rainfall fields covering the 200 000 km2 study region; precipitable water from a network of global positioning system (GPS) measurements; and vertically integrated water vapor flux derived from GPS precipitable water, radar velocity–azimuth display (VAD) wind profiles, and radiosonde humidity profiles are utilized.

abstract = {The drop size distribution (DSD) describes the microstructure of liquid precipitation. The high variability of the DSD reflects the variety of microphysical processes controlling raindrop properties and affects the retrieval of rainfall. An analysis of the effects of DSD subgrid variability on areal estimation of precipitation is presented. Data used were recorded with a network of disdrometers in Ard{\`{e}}che, France. DSD variability was studied over two typical scales: 5 km 3 5 km, similar to the ground footprint size of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) spaceborne weather radar, and 2.8 km 3 2.8 km, an operational pixel size of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) numerical weather model. Stochastic simulation was used to generate high-resolution grids of DSD estimates over the regions of interest, constrained by experimental DSDs measured by disdrometers. From these grids, areal DSD estimates were derived. The error introduced by assuming a point measurement to be representative of the areal DSD was quantitatively characterized and was shown to increase with the size of the considered area and with drop size and to decrease with the integration time. The controlled framework allowed for the accuracy of retrieval algorithms to be in-vestigated. Rainfall variables derived by idealized simulations of GPM-and COSMO-style algorithms were compared to subgrid distributions of the same variables. While rain rate and radar reflectivity were well represented, the estimated drop concentration and mass-weighted mean drop diameter were often less representative of subgrid values.},

However, current large-scale land models (as a component of Earth Sys- tem Models, or ESMs) do not yet reflect the best hydrologic process understanding or utilize the large amount of hydrologic observations for model testing. This paper discusses the opportunities and key chal- lenges to improve hydrologic process representations and benchmarking in ESM land models, suggesting that (1) land model development can benefit from recent advances in hydrology, both through incorporat- ing key processes (e.g., groundwater-surface water interactions) and new approaches to describe multiscale spatial variability and hydrologic connectivity; (2) accelerating model advances requires comprehensive hydrologic benchmarking in order to systematically evaluate competing alternatives, understand model weaknesses, and prioritize model development needs, and (3) stronger collaboration is needed between the hydrology and ESM modeling communities, both through greater engagement of hydrologists in ESM land model development, and through rigorous evaluation of ESM hydrology performance in research watersheds or Critical Zone Observatories. Such coordinated efforts in advancing hydrology in ESMs have the potential to substantially impact energy, carbon, and nutrient cycle prediction capabilities through the fundamental role hydrologic processes play in regulating these cycles.},

abstract = {No consensus has yet been reached regarding the influence of rainfall spatial variability on runoff modelling at catchment outlets. To eliminate modelling and measurement errors, in addition to controlling rainfall variability and both the characteristics and hydrological behaviour of catchments, we propose to proceed by simulation. We have developed a simulation chain that combines a stream network model, a rainfall simulator and a distributed hydrological model (with four production functions and a distributed transfer function). Our objective here is to use this simulation chain as a simplified test bed in order to better understand the impact of the spatial variability of rainfall forcing. We applied the chain to contrasted situations involving catchments ranging from a few tens to several hundreds of square km2, thus corresponding to urban and peri-urban catchments for which surface runoff constitutes the dominant process. The results obtained confirm that the proposed simulation approach is helpful to better understand the influence of rainfall spatial variability on the catchment response. We have shown that significant dispersion exists not only between the various simulation scenarios (defined by a rainfall configuration and a catchment configuration), but also within each simulation scenario. These results show that the organisation of rainfall during the study event over the study catchment plays an important role, leading us to examine rainfall variability indexes capable of summarising the influence of rainfall spatial organisation on the catchment response. Thanks to the simulation chain, we have tested the variability indexes of Zoccatelli et al. (2010) and improved them by proposing two other indexes.},

abstract = {This paper addresses rainfall radar measurement in mountainous areas where numerous catchments subject to flash flooding are located. The main sources of error affecting the quantitative use of weather radar data are examined with special attention paid to the influence of topography and altitude. A radar in a mountainous region is affected by specific measurement errors such as beam blockage; other sources of error like bright band interception can be enhanced by the effect of altitude. This work is based on data collected during the 86-88 Cevennes Experiment conducted in a mountainous Mediterranean region in the south of France prone to flash floods. Analysis of the main sources of error leads to the following observations. Beam blockage can be corrected using digital terrain models with the correction efficiency depending on the accuracy of the radar antenna pointing direction. The influence of vertical variations in radar reflectivity is shown to be taken into account at an hourly time step in order to provide satisfactory range-dependent corrections. Additionally, the control of the stability of the radar signal using strong ground clutter is described. Because of attenuation effects, the use of a 10-cm wavelength is recommended for surveying intense rain events which regularly affect Mediterranean regions. The error due to an unadapted Z-R relationship is shown to depend on the statistical distribution of reflectivity over the catchment where the rainfall measurement is utilized.},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal variability of rainfall, especially at fine temporal and spatial scales can significantly affect flood generation, leading to a large variability in the flood response and uncertainty in its prediction. In this study we quantify the impact of rainfall spatial and temporal structure on the catchment hydrological response based on a numerical experiment. Rainfall ensembles generated using a state-of-the-art space-time stochastic model are used as input into a distributed process-based hydrological model. The sensitivity of the hydrograph to several structural characteristics of storm rainfall for three soil moisture initial conditions is numerically assessed at the basin outlet of an Alpine catchment in central Switzerland. The results highlight that the flood response is strongly affected by the temporal correlation of rainfall and to a lesser extent by its spatial variability. Initial soil moisture conditions play a paramount role in mediating the response. We identify the underlying mechanistic explanations in terms of runoff generation and connectivity of saturated areas that determine the sensitivity of flood response to the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall. We show that the element that mostly influences both the flood peak and the time of peak occurrence is the clustering of saturated areas in the catchment which leads to local enhanced runoff. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In this way, a total of 24 rain periods have been analyzed according to a geostatistical approach. This analysis has focused on the non-zero rainfall variogram. The studied rain periods were recorded by the weather radar of Treilli??res (10. km north of Nantes, France) in 2009. This radar device provides rainfall radar images with a high level of spatial resolution (250. m ?? 250. m) and instantaneous temporal resolution. Results indicated four different types of rainfall fields, which display very different variability scales, including double structures within the same field. These four types of rainfall fields can be characterized by their climatological variograms, as calculated for increasing time resolutions: instantaneous, 5. min, 15. min, and 30. min, thus making it possible to estimate the decorrelation distance (i.e. range). This study highlights the benefit of radar images featuring high temporal and spatial resolution, which in turn allow studying small-scale variability. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The observation strategy of the field experiment was devised to improve knowledge of the following key components leading to heavy precipitation and flash flooding in the region: 1) the marine atmospheric f lows that transport moist and conditionally unstable air toward the coasts, 2) the Mediterranean Sea acting as a moisture and energy source, 3) the dynamics and microphysics of the convective systems producing heavy precipitation, and 4) the hydrological processes during flash floods. This article provides the rationale for developing this first HyMeX field experiment and an overview of its design and execution.

abstract = {Drainage basins in many parts of the world are ungauged or poorly gauged, and in some cases existing measurement networks are declining. The problem is compounded by the impacts of human-induced changes to the land surface and climate, occurring at the local, regional and global scales. Predictions of ungauged or poorly gauged basins under these conditions are highly uncertain. The IAHS Decade on Predictions in Ungauged Basins, or PUB, is a new initiative launched by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS), aimed at formulating and implementing appropriate science programmes to engage and energize the scientific community, in a coordinated manner, towards achieving major advances in the capacity to make predictions in ungauged basins. The PUB scientific programme focuses on the estimation of predictive uncertainty, and its subsequent reduction, as its central theme. A general hydrological prediction system contains three components: (a) a model that describes the key processes of interest, (b) a set of parameters that represent those landscape properties that govern critical processes, and (c) appropriate meteorological inputs (where needed) that drive the basin response. Each of these three components of the prediction system, is either not known at all, or at best known imperfectly, due to the inherent multi-scale space–time heterogeneity of the hydrological system, especially in ungauged basins. PUB will therefore include a set of targeted scientific programmes that attempt to make inferences about climatic inputs, parameters and model structures from available but inadequate data and process knowledge, at the basin of interest and/or from other similar basins, with robust measures of the uncertainties involved, and their impacts on predictive uncertainty. Through generation of improved understanding, and methods for the efficient quantification of the underlying multi-scale heterogeneity of the basin and its response, PUB will inexorably lead to new, innovative methods for hydrological predictions in ungauged basins in different parts of the world, combined with significant reductions of predictive uncertainty. In this way, PUB will demonstrate the value of data, as well as provide the information needed to make predictions in ungauged basins, and assist in capacity building in the use of new technologies. This paper presents a summary of the science and implementation plan of PUB, with a call to the hydrological community to participate actively in the realization of these goals.},

abstract = {Severe storms and associated floods have been a major natural catastrophe in a number of cities over the last decade. The risk of extreme precipitation events is usually assessed by return periods, which are evaluated from frequency analysis of point rainfall accumulations. Point return periods associated with design quantiles are traditionally used in the design of structures to control storm runoff and floods. Return periods have also acquired great meaning in hydrology when analyzing observed events and qualifying their severity. This study investigates the characterization of the return period of a rainfall event over a given area, highlighting the importance of considering its spatial dimension. Three storm events observed in the city of Marseilles, France, are studied. Severity graphs and severity diagrams are developed for each storm event. They allow us to visualize the strong variability of return periods within a storm. For a given rainfall duration, one can observe point return period estimations varying from ordinary values (less than 1 or 2 years) to rare or even exceptional values (10-100 years) when considering different rain gauges. Also, for a given rain gauge, different return periods are estimated for different rainfall durations and important differences can be found between the obtained values. The degree of severity of each storm event for the city is shown to depend also on the extent of heavy rain areas and therefore on the spatial structure of rainfall intensities. Storm severity visualization could be useful in evaluating the importance of observed rainstorms over a city and in helping decision makers in real time water management.},

abstract = {Water fluxes in catchments are controlled by physical processes and material properties that are complex, heterogeneous, and poorly characterized by direct measurement. As a result, parsimonious theories of catchment hydrology remain elusive. Here I describe how one class of catchments (those in which discharge is determined by the volume of water in storage) can be characterized as simple first-order nonlinear dynamical systems, and I show that the form of their governing equations can be inferred directly from measurements of streamflow fluctuations. I illustrate this approach using data from the headwaters of the Severn and Wye rivers at Plynlimon in mid-Wales. This approach leads to quantitative estimates of catchment dynamic storage, recession time scales, and sensitivity to antecedent moisture, suggesting that it is useful for catchment characterization. It also yields a first-order nonlinear differential equation that can be used to directly simulate the streamflow hydrograph from precipitation and evapotranspiration time series. This single-equation rainfall-runoff model predicts streamflow at Plynlimon as accurately as other models that are much more highly parameterized. It can also be analytically inverted; thus, it can be used to {\&}{\#}8220;do hydrology backward,{\&}{\#}8221; that is, to infer time series of whole-catchment precipitation directly from fluctuations in streamflow. At Plynlimon, precipitation rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations agree with rain gauge measurements as closely as two rain gauges in each catchment agree with each other. These inferred precipitation rates are not calibrated to precipitation measurements in any way, making them a strong test of the underlying theory. The same approach can be used to estimate whole-catchment evapotranspiration rates during rainless periods. At Plynlimon, evapotranspiration rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations exhibit seasonal and diurnal cycles that agree semiquantitatively with Penman-Monteith estimates. Thus, streamflow hydrographs may be useful for reconstructing precipitation and evapotranspiration records where direct measurements are unavailable, unreliable, or unrepresentative at the scale of the landscape.},

abstract = {A tornado outbreak occurred in central Oklahoma on 10 May 2010, including two tornadoes with enhanced Fujita scale ratings of 4 (EF-4). Tragically, three deaths were reported along with significant property damage. Several strong and violent tornadoes occurred near Norman, Oklahoma, which is a major hub for severe storms research and is arguably one of the best observed regions of the country with multiple Doppler radars operated by both the federal government and the University of Oklahoma (OU). One of the most recent additions to the radars in Norman is the high-resolution OU Polarimetric Radar for Innovations in Meteorology and Engineering (OU-PRIME). As the name implies, the radar is used as a platform for research and education in both science and engineering studies using polarimetric radar. To facilitate usage of the system by students and faculty, OU-PRIME was constructed adjacent to the National Weather Center building on the OU research campus. On 10 May 2010, several tornadoes formed near the campus while OU researchers were operating OU-PRIME in a sector scanning mode, providing polarimetric radar data with unprecedented resolution and quality. In this article, the environmental conditions leading to the 10 May 2010 outbreak will be described, an overview of OU-PRIME will be provided, and several examples of the data and possible applications will be summarized. These examples will highlight supercell polarimetric signatures during and after tornadogenesis, and they will describe how the polarimetric signatures are related to observations of reflectivity and velocity.

abstract = {Hydrologic synthesis, I believe, is needed in at least three respects: across processes, where the challenge is how to represent complex interacting dynamic systems including feedbacks between system components; across places, where the challenge is how to synthesize the plethora of case studies around the world in the past decades; and across scales, where one is interested in the general characteristics of processes as a function of space and time scales for the same site or an ensemble of sites. Seeking explanations for patterns, puzzles, and paradoxes is the way toward synthesis, and this should be pursued through two approaches. The first is to engage in more complex model building, but model complexity may ultimately limit the practical applicability of these models. The alternative is to seek more parsimonious avenues to synthesis. One of them is classification and similarity concepts which, generally speaking, can be profitably used when the processes are not fully understood. This often is the case in hydrology. Among the key unresolved issues and research challenges in hydrology is separating the predictable and the unpredictable. Synthesis, I think, needs to focus on the patterns of predictability. There is also an important, alternative, role of models in water resources management using models as communication tools. The best model then is not the most accurate one but the one that serves best the purpose of reaching a consensus among the players.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to characterize the climatology of extreme rainfall and flash flooding in Atlanta, Georgia using high-resolution land surface, rainfall, and discharge datasets. We examine nine urban watersheds in the Atlanta area that range in size from 3.7 to 225 km2 and exhibit a range of urban development and land-use characteristics. We develop a high-resolution 15 min, 1 km2 radar rainfall data set for the 2002{\&}{\#}8211;2010 period using the Hydro-NEXRAD system with volume scan reflectivity observations from the Atlanta WSR-88D radar and rainfall observations from a dense network of 72 U.S. Geological Survey rain gauges. Bias-corrected radar rainfall fields accurately capture the spatial and temporal structure of heavy rainfall. There is enhancement of heavy rainfall within and east of the urban core, and a rainfall minimum north and northwest of the city. There has been an increase in variability of annual flood peaks in Atlanta since the 1960s associated with urban impacts on runoff production. Flood response is dependent on a combination of basin size, drainage network structure, spatial distribution of land use, and basin storage in urban soils and storm water detention ponds. Future studies of urban rainfall modification in Atlanta and elsewhere should consider the influence of regional topography and other geographic features on the storm environment.},

abstract = {Most of previous assessments of hydrologic model performance are fragmented, based on small number of catchments, different methods or time periods and do not link the results to landscape or climate characteristics. This study uses large-sample hydrology to identify major catchment controls on daily runoff simulations. It is based on a conceptual lumped hydrological model (GR6J), a collection of 29 catchment characteristics, a multinational set of 1103 catchments located in Austria, France, and Germany and four runoff model efficiency criteria. Two analyses are conducted to assess how features and criteria are linked: (i) a one-dimensional analysis based on the Kruskal-Wallis test and (ii) a multidimensional analysis based on regression trees and investigating the interplay between features. The catchment features most affecting model performance are the flashiness of precipitation and streamflow (computed as the ratio of absolute day-to-day fluctuations by the total amount in a year), the seasonality of evaporation, the catchment area, and the catchment aridity. Nonflashy, nonseasonal, large, and nonarid catchments show the best performance for all the tested criteria. We argue that this higher performance is due to fewer nonlinear responses (higher correlation between precipitation and streamflow) and lower input and output variability for such catchments. Finally, we show that, compared to national sets, multinational sets increase results transferability because they explore a wider range of hydroclimatic conditions.},

abstract = {The methods kriging with external drift (KED) and indicator kriging with external drift (IKED) are used for the spatial interpolation of hourly rainfall from rain gauges using additional information from radar, daily precipitation of a denser network, and elevation. The techniques are illustrated using data from the storm period of the 10th to the 13th of August 2002 that led to the extreme flood event in the Elbe river basin in Germany. Cross-validation is applied to compare the interpolation performance of the KED and IKED methods using different additional information with the univariate reference methods nearest neighbour (NN) or Thiessen polygons, inverse square distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK) and ordinary indicator kriging (IK). Special attention is given to the analysis of the impact of the semivariogram estimation on the interpolation performance. Hourly and average semivariograms are inferred from daily, hourly and radar data considering either isotropic or anisotropic behaviour using automatic and manual fitting procedures. The multivariate methods KED and IKED clearly outperform the univariate ones with the most important additional information being radar, followed by precipitation from the daily network and elevation, which plays only a secondary role here. The best performance is achieved when all additional information are used simultaneously with KED. The indicator-based kriging methods provide, in some cases, smaller root mean square errors than the methods, which use the original data, but at the expense of a significant loss of variance. The impact of the semivariogram on interpolation performance is not very high. The best results are obtained using an automatic fitting procedure with isotropic variograms either from hourly or radar data. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a first assessment of the hy- drometeorological potential of a C-band doppler weather radar recently installed by the Royal Meteorological Insti- tute of Belgium near the village ofWideumont in the south- ern Ardennes region. An analysis of the vertical profile of reflectivity for two contrasting rainfall events confirms the expected differences between stratiform and convective pre- cipitation. The mean areal rainfall over the Ourthe catchment upstreamof Tabreux estimated from theWideumont weather radar using the standard Marshall-Palmer reflectivity-rain rate relation shows biases between +128{\%} and −42{\%} for six selected precipitation events. For two rainfall events the radar-estimated mean areal rainfall is applied to the gauge- calibrated (lumped) HBV-model for the Ourthe upstream of Tabreux, resulting in a significant underestimation with re- spect to the observed discharge for one event and a closer match for another. A bootstrap analysis using the radar data reveals that the uncertainty in the hourly discharge from the ∼1600km2 catchment associated with the sampling un- certainty of the mean areal rainfall estimated from 10 rain gauges evenly spread over the catchment amounts to ±25{\%} for the two events analyzed. This uncertainty is shown to be of the same order of magnitude as that associated with the model variables describing the initial state of the model.},

abstract = {Despite the availability of weather radar data at high spatial (1 km(2)) and temporal (5-15 min) resolution, ground-based rain gauges continue to be necessary for accurate estimation of storm rainfall input to catchments during flash flood events, especially in mountainous catchments. Given economical considerations, a long-standing problem in catchment hydrology is to establish optimal placement of a small number of rain gauges to acquire data on both rainfall depth and spatiotemporal variability of intensity during extreme storm events. Using weather radar observations and a dense network of 40 tipping bucket rain gauges, this study examines whether it is possible to determine a reliable "best" set of rain gauge locations for the Sabino Canyon catchment near Tucson, Arizona, USA, given its complex topography and dominant storm track pattern. High-quality rainfall data are used to evaluate all possible configurations of a "practical" network having from one to four rain gauges. A multicriteria design strategy is used to guide rain gauge placement, by simultaneously minimizing the residual percent bias and maximizing the coefficient of correlation between the estimated and true mean areal rainfall and minimizing the normalized spatial mean squared error between the estimated and true spatiotemporal rainfall distribution. The performance of the optimized rain gauge network was then compared against randomly designed network ensembles by evaluating the quality of streamflows predicted using the Kinematic Runoff and Erosion (KINEROS2) event-based rainfall-runoff model. Our results indicate that the multicriteria strategy provided a robust design by which a sparse but accurate network of rain gauges could be implemented for semiarid basins such as the one studied.},

The study area includes seven operational basins of varying size and location in the southeastern United States. The analysis indicates that agreements between the datasets vary considerably from basin to basin and also temporally within the basins. The analysis also includes evaluation of MAPS in comparison with MAPG for use in flow forecasting with a lumped hydrologic model [Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA)]. The latter evaluation investigates two different parameter sets, the first obtained using manual calibration on historical MAPG, and the second obtained using automatic calibration on both MAPS and MAPG, but over a shorter time period (23 months). Results indicate that the overall performance of the model simu- lations using MAPS depends on both the bias in the precipitation estimates and the size of the basins, with poorer performance in basins of smaller size (large bias between MAPG and MAPS) and better perfor- mance in larger basins (less bias between MAPG and MAPS). When using MAPS, calibration of the parameters significantly improved the model performance. 1.},

abstract = {Different relations between surface rainfall rate, R, and high-resolution polarimetric X-band radar observations were evaluated using a dense network of rain gauge measurements over complex terrain in Central Italian Alps. The specific differential phase shift, KDP, rainfall algorithm (RKDP) although associated with low systematic error it exhibits low sensitivity to the spatial variability of rainfall as compared to the standard algorithm (RSTD) that is based on the reflectivity-to-rainfall (Z-R) relationship. On the other hand, the dependence of the reflectivity measurement on the absolute radar calibration and the rain-path radar signal attenuation introduces significant systematic error on the RSTD rainfall estimates. The study shows that adjusting the Z-R relationship for mean-field bias determined using the RKDP estimates as reference is the best technique for acquiring unbiased radar-rainfall estimates at fine space-time scales. Overall, the bias of the RKDP-adjusted Z-R estimator is shown to be lower than 10{\%} for both storm cases, while the relative root-mean-square error is shown to range from 0.6 (convective storm) to 0.9 (stratiform storm). A vertical rainfall profile correction (VPR) technique is tested in this study for the stratiform storm case. The method is based on a newly developed VPR algorithm that uses the X-band polarimetric information to identify the properties of the melting layer and devices a precipitation profile that varies for each radar volume scan to correct the radar-rainfall estimates. Overall, when accounting for the VPR effect there is up to 70{\%} reduction in the systematic error of the 3° elevation estimates, while the reduction in terms of relative root-mean-square error is limited to within 10{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The radar-estimated rainfall was derived from Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) Level II base reflectivity data and was supplemented by ground-based rain-gauge data.

The study explicitly differentiates between the response of simulated saturation-excess runoff and infiltration-excess runoff to these uncertainties. The results indicate that infiltration-excess runoff generation is much more sensitive than saturation-excess runoff generation to both types of precipitation uncertainty. Furthermore, significant reductions in infiltration-excess runoff volume occur when the temporal and spatial resolution of the precipitation input is decreased. A method is developed to relate this storm-dependent reduction in runoff volume to the spatial heterogeneity of the highest-intensity rainfall periods during a storm.},

abstract = {Radar estimates of rainfall are being increasingly applied to flood forecasting applications. Errors are inherent both in the process of estimating rainfall from radar and in the modelling of the rainfall-runoff transformation. The study aims at building a framework for the assessment of uncertainty that is consistent with the limitations of the model and data available and that allows a direct quantitative comparison between model predictions obtained by using radar and raingauge rainfall inputs. The study uses radar data from a mountainous region in northern Italy where complex topography amplifies radar errors due to radar beam occlusion and variability of precipitation with height. These errors, together with other error sources, are adjusted by applying a radar rainfall estimation algorithm. Radar rainfall estimates, adjusted and not, are used as an input to TOPMODEL for flood simulation over the Posina catchment (116 km(2)). Hydrological model parameter uncertainty is explicitly accounted for by use of the GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation). Statistics are proposed to evaluate both the wideness of the uncertainty limits and the percentage of observations which fall within the uncertainty bounds. Results show the critical importance of proper adjustment of radar estimates and the use of radar estimates as close to ground as possible. Uncertainties affecting runoff predictions from adjusted radar data are close to those obtained by using a dense raingauge network, at least for the lowest radar observations available.

abstract = {A spatially distributed wireless-sensor network, installed across the 2154 km2 portion of the 5311 km2 American River basin above 1500 m elevation, provided spatial measurements of temperature, relative humidity, and snow depth in the Sierra Nevada, California. The network consisted of 10 sensor clusters, each with 10 measurement nodes, distributed to capture the variability in topography and vegetation cover. The sensor network captured significant spatial heterogeneity in rain versus snow precipitation for water-year 2014, variability that was not apparent in the more limited operational data. Using daily dew-point temperature to track temporal elevational changes in the rain-snow transition, the amount of snow accumulation at each node was used to estimate the fraction of rain versus snow. This resulted in an underestimate of total precipitation below the 0°C dew-point elevation, which averaged 1730 m across 10 precipitation events, indicating that measuring snow does not capture total precipitation. We suggest blending lower elevation rain gauge data with higher-elevation sensor-node data for each event to estimate total precipitation. Blended estimates were on average 15–30{\%} higher than using either set of measurements alone. Using data from the current operational snow-pillow sites gives even lower estimates of basin-wide precipitation. Given the increasing importance of liquid precipitation in a warming climate, a strategy that blends distributed measurements of both liquid and solid precipitation will provide more accurate basin-wide precipitation estimates, plus spatial and temporal patters of snow accumulation and melt in a basin.},

abstract = {Abstract As part of the evolution and future enhancement of the Next Generation Weather Radars (NEXRAD), the National Severe Storms Laboratory recently upgraded the KOUN Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) to include a polarimetric capability. The proof of concept was tested in central Oklahoma during a 1-yr demonstration project referred to as the Joint Polarization Experiment (JPOLE). This paper presents an overview of polarimetric algorithms for rainfall estimation and hydrometeor classification and their performance during JPOLE. The quality of rainfall measurements is validated on a large dataset from the Oklahoma Mesonet and Agricultural Research Service Micronet rain gauge networks. The comparison demonstrates that polarimetric rainfall estimates are often dramatically superior to those provided by conventional rainfall algorithms. Using a synthetic R(Z, KDP, ZDR) polarimetric rainfall relation, rms errors are reduced by a factor of 1.7 for point measurements and 3.7 for areal estimates [when compared to results from a conventional R(Z) relation]. Radar data quality improvement, hail identification, rain/snow discrimination, and polarimetric tornado detection are also illustrated for selected events.},

However, early evaluation of FLASH tools in a series of simulated forecasting operations, it was believed that the data aggregation and visualization methods might have contributed to forecasting a large number of false alarms. The present study addresses the question of how two alternative data aggregation and visualization methods affect signal detection of flash floods. A sample of 30 participants viewed a series of stimuli created from FLASH images and were asked to judge whether or not they predicted significant or insignificant amounts of flash flooding. Analyses revealed that choice of aggregation method did affect probability of detection. Additional visual indicators such as geographic scale of the stimuli and threat level affected the odds of interpreting the model predictions correctly as well as congruence in responses between national and local scale model outputs.},

abstract = {The goal of this study is to diagnose the manner in which radar-rainfall input affects peak flow simulation uncertainties across scales. We used the distributed physically based hydrological model CUENCAS with parameters that are estimated from available data and without fitting the model output to discharge observations. We evaluated the model's performance using (1) observed streamflow at the outlet of nested basins ranging in scale from 20 to 16,000 km(2) and (2) streamflow simulated by a well-established and extensively calibrated hydrological model used by the US National Weather Service (SAC-SMA). To mimic radar-rainfall uncertainty, we applied a recently proposed statistical model of radar-rainfall error to produce rainfall ensembles based on different expected error scenarios. We used the generated ensembles as input for the hydrological model and summarized the effects on flow sensitivities using a relative measure of the ensemble peak flow dispersion for every link in the river network. Results show that peak flow simulation uncertainty is strongly dependent on the catchment scale. Uncertainty decreases with increasing catchment drainage area due to the aggregation effect of the river network that filters out small-scale uncertainties. The rate at which uncertainty changes depends on the error structure of the input rainfall fields. We found that random errors that are uncorrelated in space produce high peak flow variability for small scale basins, but uncertainties decrease rapidly as scale increases. In contrast, spatially correlated errors produce less scatter in peak flows for small scales, but uncertainty decreases slowly with increasing catchment size. This study demonstrates the large impact of scale on uncertainty in hydrological simulations and demonstrates the need for a more robust characterization of the uncertainty structure in radar-rainfall. Our results are diagnostic and illustrate the benefits of using the calibration-free, multiscale framework to investigate uncertainty propagation with hydrological models.},

abstract = {1. Introduction By providing high-resolution quantitative precipitation infor-mation (QPI), weather radars have revolutionized hydrology in the last two decades. With the aid of GIS technology, radar-based quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) have enabled routine high-resolution hydrologic modeling in many parts of the world. Given the ever-increasing need for higher-resolution hydrologic and water resources information for a wide range of applications, one may expect that the use of weather radar will only grow. Despite the tremendous progress, a number of significant scien-tific, technological and engineering challenges remain to realize its potential. New challenges are also emerging as new areas of applications are discovered, explored and pursued. The purpose of this special issue is to provide the readership with some of the latest advances, lessons learned, experiences gained, and science issues and challenges related to hydrologic applications of weather radar. The special issue features 20 contributions on various topics which reflect the increasing diversity as well as the areas of focus in radar hydrology today. The contributions may be grouped as follows: Radar QPE (Kwon et al.; Hall et al.; Chen and Chandrasekar; Seo and Krajewski; Sandford). Multi-radar and multisensor precipitation analysis (Fortin et al.; Kim et al.; Rafieeinasab et al. a). Hydrologic modeling (Emmanuel et al.; Zoccatelli et al.; Dyer et al.). Urban hydrologic and hydraulic applications (Rafieeinasab et al. b ; Ochoa-Rodriguez et al.; Wang et al.). Precipitation frequency analysis (Marra and Morin; Eldardiry et al.). Hydrometeorological process studies (Campos and Wang; Wilson and Barros). Precipitation nowcasting, forecasting (Yu et al.). Hydrometeorological applications (Lo Conti et al.). 2. Recent progress and advances Perhaps the most significant change that has taken place in hydrologic applications of weather radar is that it is now consid-ered an essential tool for operational hydrology and water resources management in many parts of the world. In some coun-tries, the water sector has appropriated weather radar exclusively for hydrologic applications (Kwon et al.). One of the early drivers for radar hydrology was distributed hydrologic modeling to allow simulation of streamflow, soil moisture and other hydrologic vari-ables at any location within the catchment modeled. Today, with the aid of GIS technology, distributed modeling is routinely prac-ticed in semi-distributed or gridded form (Reed et al., 2004). Among the recent scientific and technological advances in weather radar, by far the most important is polarimetry. Polari-metric radar has led to improved QPE owing to improved data quality (Tabary et al., 2011) and the availability of rain rate retrie-val techniques that are immune to attenuation and partial beam blockage (Bringi et al., 2001; Diederich et al., 2015). With the strong appeal of lower cost, polarimetric X-band radar is enjoying resurgence (Le Conti et al., this issue) particularly in urban applica-tions where high-resolution sensing is essential (Chen and Chandrasekar, 2015). Polarimetry has also advanced hydrometeor classification (Lim et al., 2013) and understanding of hydrometeo-rological processes associated with heavy-to-extreme precipitation (Ryzhkov et al., 2011) which are critical to quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) and, in particular, microphysical assimilation of radar data into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models (Jung et al., 2005). 3. Challenges and needs Despite the very considerable progress made during the last two decades, the users cannot yet, a priori, be fully confident of radar QPI. While polarimetric radar has already made a large pos-itive impact, concerted research efforts are needed to fully benefit from it, including advancing understanding of hydrometeorologi-cal processes, establishing fundamental relationships between the microphysical processes and the various polarimetry-derived variables, and improving understanding, characterization and correction of errors that are important to QPE and QPF (see, e.g., Sandford). For shorter-wavelength radars, signal extinction from attenuation in heavy rainfall or hail is a daunting challenge. Compositing with other radar data from similar and/or longer-wavelength systems is necessary to address the above (Zhang et al., 2011; Rafieeinasab et al. a). A large contributing factor to the success of radar hydrology has been multisensor QPE which merges radar QPE with rain gauge data and satellite QPE as necessary. For example, the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS) precipitation analysis (http://water.weather.gov/precip/), which mosaics the Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE) products (Seo et al., 2010) from the},

abstract = {Radar precipitation estimates can improve hydrologic prediction over a range of spatial scales represented by both rural and urban basins. Flooding results from the combination of heavy precipitation and the distributed hydraulic and hydrologic characteristics of the basin. Accuracy and spatial scaling of radar estimated rainfall, and its impact at relevant hydrologic scales is an important determinant of hydrologic prediction accuracy and flood forecasting. Results of simulations using archival radar events are used to demonstrate the sources of uncertainty affecting site-specific flood forecasts within the distributed hydrologic model, Vflo. Radar data used in this analysis are derived from both S-band (NEXRAD/88D) and the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA), polarimetric X-band radars. X-band radars have the capability to provide higher spatial and temporal resolution than the conventional radars operating at S-band. However, compared to S-band, X-band radars have shorter wavelengths and suffer from attenuation, or even total extinction of the radar signal at short ranges from the radar. Degradation of precipitation mapping is a serious concern, especially in heavy precipitation over distances associated with watersheds prone to flooding. Compared to rain gauge accumulations, X-band radar polarimetric rainfall estimates were significantly degraded beyond about 15km from the radars. With rainfall input derived from X-band radars, uncertainty in runoff volume scales with watershed area as a smooth monotonically decreasing function as area increases due to averaging of random errors in the input. Relative to estimates derived from S-band radar, unreliable hydrograph response was produced using X-band polarimetric rainfall estimates as input to a physics-based distributed hydrologic model, especially for watershed areas less than about 20km2. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The central hypothesis of a nonlinear geophysical flood theory postulates that, given space-time rainfall intensity for a rainfall-runoff event, solutions of coupled mass and momentum conservation differential equations governing runoff generation and transport in a self-similar river network produce spatial scaling, or a power law, relation between peak discharge and drainage area in the limit of large area. The excellent fit of a power law for the destructive flood event of June 2008 in the 32,400-km(2) Iowa River basin over four orders of magnitude variation in drainage areas supports the central hypothesis. The challenge of predicting observed scaling exponent and intercept from physical processes is explained. We show scaling in mean annual peak discharges, and briefly discuss that it is physically connected with scaling in multiple rainfall-runoff events. Scaling in peak discharges would hold in a non-stationary climate due to global warming but its slope and intercept would change. Citation: Gupta, V. K., R. Mantilla, B. M. Troutman, D. Dawdy, and W.

abstract = {Distributed hydrological modelling using space-time estimates of rainfall from weather radar provides a natural approach to area-wide flood forecasting and warning at any location, whether gauged or ungauged. However, radar estimates of rainfall may lack consistent, quantitative accuracy. Also, the formulation of hydrological models in distributed form may be problematic due to process complexity and scaling issues. Here, the aim is to first explore ways of improving radar rainfall accuracy through combination with raingauge network data via integrated multiquadric methods. When the resulting gridded rainfall estimates are employed as input to hydrological models, the simulated river flows show marked improvements when compared to using radar data alone. Secondly, simple forms of physical-conceptual distributed hydrological model are considered, capable of exploiting spatial datasets on topography and, where necessary, land-cover, soil and geology properties. The simplest Grid-to-Grid model uses only digital terrain data to delineate flow pathways and to control runoff production, the latter by invoking a probability-distributed relation linking terrain slope to soil absorption capacity. Model performance is assessed over nested river basins in northwest England, employing a lumped model as a reference. When the distributed model is used with the gridded radar-based rainfall estimators, it shows particular benefits for forecasting at ungauged locations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {[ 1] Uncertainties in assessing the effects of global-scale perturbations on the climate system arise primarily from an inadequate understanding of the hydrological cycle: on land, in oceans, and in the atmosphere and biosphere. Because of this uncertainty, almost all science-based initiatives have expressed the need for continued advances in global observations and modeling of the Earth system. It is in this spirit that we advocate establishing a hydrologic remote sensing observatory (RSO) to advance sensing technologies and their use in scientific inquiry into hydrologic processes. There are two fundamental reasons why establishing such a RSO is timely. The first is operational: Developing assimilation techniques to estimate unobserved fluxes and uncertainties in hydrologic forecasts has sufficiently matured to take advantage of computing facilities and detailed hydrologic observations shaped by the RSO. The second is scientific: This RSO will permit us to refine knowledge from physical and hydrologic models that can then be converted to local and global strategies for water resources management and ecosystem health evaluation. The authors outline the conceptual design, scope, and functionality of a RSO and present four examples to illustrate how the hydrologic community can take advantage of such facility.},

abstract = {This study aims to assess the impact of a class of radar rainfall errors on prediction uncertainty of a conceptual water balance model. Uncertainty assessment is canied out by means of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation procedure (GLUE). The effects of model input and structural error are separated, and the potential for compensating errors between them is investigated. It is shown that the radar rainfall bias term operates in a multiplicative sense on the model structural uncertainty, by either magnimg or reducing it according to the sign of the bias. The results show also that adjustment of radar rainfall, aimed to remove local biases and to reduce random errors, allows ensunng that a larger percentage of the observed flows are enclosed by the uncertainty bounds, with respect to nonadjusted radar input. However, this is obtained at the pnce of increasing the wideness of the uncertainty bounds. This effect is emphasized with increasing the radar beam elevation. As a second step, the issue of the impact of radar rainfall estimation error on model parameter distribution and parameter transferability across sites under the radar umbrella is examined. Radar data at different radar beam elevations are used to simulate radar estimation errors at different distances from the radar site and to analyze the impact of these errors on prediction uncertainty. The results show that distortion of parameter distribution due to radar error may be considerable and that adjustment of radar rainfall estimates improves the regionalization potential of radarbased precipitation estimates (at least for ranges less than 70 km).},

abstract = {Monitoring Earth's terrestrial water conditions is critically important to many hydrological applications such as global food production; assessing water resources sustainability; and flood, drought, and climate change prediction. These needs have motivated the development of pilot monitoring and prediction systems for terrestrial hydrologic and vegetative states, but to date only at the rather coarse spatial resolutions ({\&}{\#}8764;10{\&}{\#}8211;100 km) over continental to global domains. Adequately addressing critical water cycle science questions and applications requires systems that are implemented globally at much higher resolutions, on the order of 1 km, resolutions referred to as hyperresolution in the context of global land surface models. This opinion paper sets forth the needs and benefits for a system that would monitor and predict the Earth's terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. We discuss six major challenges in developing a system: improved representation of surface-subsurface interactions due to fine-scale topography and vegetation; improved representation of land-atmospheric interactions and resulting spatial information on soil moisture and evapotranspiration; inclusion of water quality as part of the biogeochemical cycle; representation of human impacts from water management; utilizing massively parallel computer systems and recent computational advances in solving hyperresolution models that will have up to 109 unknowns; and developing the required in situ and remote sensing global data sets. We deem the development of a global hyperresolution model for monitoring the terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles a {\&}{\#}8220;grand challenge{\&}{\#}8221; to the community, and we call upon the international hydrologic community and the hydrological science support infrastructure to endorse the effort.},

abstract = {Resumen: La conexi�n entre los procesos de transporte de solutos en r�os y la diversidad en las configuraciones morfol�gicas que toman lugar a lo largo de la red de drenaje de una cuenca no ha sido ampliamente estudiada en un contexto regional de an�lisis. En la escala de tramo se han desarrollado precisas aproximaciones mediante la implementaci�n y calibraci�n de modelos de almacenamiento temporal (ADZ y TS) que permiten considerar de forma agregada los efectos de una o m�s zonas de retenci�n en el tramo. �ste tipo de aproximaciones se fundamenta en la realizaci�n de experimentos con trazadores que permiten, para un mismo tramo, identificar claras relaciones entre par�metros de transporte (tiempos de viaje) y el caudal de flujo, que son el reflejo de la organizaci�n del cauce para conservar y minimizar su gasto de energ�a, y que puede entenderse como la combinaci�n de factores como el ancho, la profundidad, la pendiente, el tama�o del sedimento, entre otros en un tramo, para conformar arreglos morfol�gicos como cascadas y salto-pozo en tramos de alta pendiente o pozo-cruces y dunas-r�pidas en tramos de baja pendiente. Por lo anterior, algunas investigaciones se�alan como una de las limitaciones de modelos de almacenamiento temporal en tramos su inhabilidad para extrapolar las inferencias hechas en un tramo hacia otros no instrumentados (empleando trazadores), aunque en otros trabajos se han presentado alternativas de regionalizaci�n de par�metros de transporte para morfolog�as homog�neas.$\backslash$nEn la escala de cuenca, por otro lado, se ha integrado el transporte de solutos en la red de drenaje con modelos hidrol�gicos distribuidos de diversa �ndole en los que no se ha resuelto completamente la transferencia de flujo en la red de drenaje. Tradicionalmente se asumen propiedades geom�tricas e hidr�ulicas homog�neas en grandes tramos lo que conlleva a grandes simplificaciones en cuanto al transporte y transformaci�n de sustancias en toda la cuenca se refiere. Este aspecto resalta nuevamente la necesidad de identificar las condiciones morfol�gicas m�s probables en la red de drenaje de una cuenca como un paso previo en el entendimiento del tr�nsito de caudales y de solutos.$\backslash$nEn dicha direcci�n, se han desarrollado marcos de clasificaci�n morfol�gica de cauces que van desde diferenciaciones preliminares basadas en caracter�sticas geomorfol�gicas de llanuras aluviales y pendientes, hasta descripciones detalladas que incluyen el tama�o del sedimento, caracter�sticas de banca llena y la litolog�a local como indicadores y criterios de clasificaci�n. Rosgen (1994) propone un sistema de clasificaci�n morfol�gica robusto partiendo de la caracterizaci�n directa en campo de numerosos tramos. Montgomery {\&} Buffington (1997) enmarcan su m�todo de clasificaci�n en t�rminos de la relaci�n entre la capacidad de transporte y el suministro de sedimentos de un tramo, aspecto se�alado como una limitaci�n por Thomson et al (2008) quienes encontraron que la pendiente y la litolog�a local de la red h�drica explicaban un alto porcentaje de la configuraci�n morfol�gica de los tramos considerados en su estudio. Por otro lado, Gonz�les (2008) present� relaciones emp�ricas para estimar los par�metros de modelos ADZ (tiempo de arribo y tiempo medio de viaje), en r�os de monta�a en funci�n del caudal (en un mismo tramo), como  estrategia de evaluaci�n de procesos de transporte en condiciones de escasez de informaci�n. De igual forma, para modelos TS, Schmid (2008) y Hart et al. (1999) muestran la interrelaci�n de los par�metros del modelo con el caudal de flujo e indican los errores detr�s de la extrapolaci�n de par�metros de una condici�n de flujo a otra en un mismo tramo.$\backslash$nLa estimaci�n de par�metros de transporte de una corriente o tramo de la misma podr�a entonces llevarse a cabo bajo la conceptualizaci�n de sus mecanismos de almacenamiento temporal en un contexto morfol�gico partiendo de teor�as de geometr�a hidr�ulica y teniendo en cuenta que la definici�n de caracter�sticas geomorf�logicas y topol�gicas de redes de drenaje se hace cada vez m�s f�cil en diferentes escalas espaciales de an�lisis gracias a la disponibilidad de informaci�n satelital, modelos de elevaci�n digital y derivaci�n de redes de drenaje superficial.},

abstract = {We recognize three primary channel-reach substrates: bedrock, alluvium, and colluvium. Bedrock reaches lack a contiguous alluvial bed and reflect high transport capacities relative to sediment supply; they are typically con-fined by valley walls and have steep slopes. In contrast, alluvial channels ex-hibit a wide variety of morphologies and roughness configurations that vary with slope and position within the channel network, and may be either con-fined, with little to no associated flood plain, or unconfined, with a well-established flood plain. We recognize five distinct alluvial reach morpholo-gies: cascade, step pool, plane bed, pool riffle, and dune ripple. Colluvial channels form an additional reach type that we recognize separately from alluvial channels, despite the common presence of a thin alluvial substrate. Colluvial channels typically are small headwater streams that flow over a colluvial valley fill and exhibit weak or ephemeral fluvial transport. Each of these channel types is distinguished by a distinctive channel-bed morphol-ogy, allowing rapid visual classification. Diagnostic features of each chan-nel type are summarized in Table 1 and discussed below. Cascade Channels The term " cascade " connotes tumbling flow, although its specific mor-phologic definition varies and often is applied to both channel units and reaches (e.g., Bisson et al., 1982; Grant et al., 1990). Our delineation of cas-cade channels focuses on streams in which energy dissipation is dominated by continuous tumbling and jet-and-wake flow over and around individual large clasts (e.g., Peterson and Mohanty, 1960) (Fig. 1A). Cascade channels generally occur on steep slopes, are narrowly confined by valley walls, and are characterized by longitudinally and laterally disorganized bed material typically consisting of cobbles and boulders (Fig. 2A). Small, partially channel-spanning pools spaced less than a channel width apart are common in cascade channels. Tumbling flow over individual grain steps and turbu-lence associated with jet-and-wake flow around grains dissipates much of the mechanical energy of the flow (Fig. 3A). Large particle size relative to flow depth makes the largest bed-forming material of cascade reaches effectively immobile during typical flows. Stud-ies of steep-gradient channels report that large bed-forming grains typically become mobile only during infrequent (i.e., 50–100 yr) hydrologic events (Grant et al., 1990; Kondolf et al., 1991; Whittaker, 1987b). Mobilization of these larger clasts is accompanied by high sediment transport rates due to the release of finer sediment trapped under and around large grains (Sawada et al., 1983; Warburton, 1992). During lesser floods, gravel stored in low en-ergy sites is mobilized and travels as bedload over larger bed-forming clasts (Griffiths, 1980; Schmidt and Ergenzinger, 1992). Gravel and finer material are locally stored on stoss and lee sides of flow obstructions (i.e., large grains and large woody debris) due to physical impoundment and genera-tion of velocity shadows. One tracer study (Kondolf et al., 1991) showed that material in such depositional sites was completely mobilized during a seven-year recurrence-interval event, whereas no tracer movement was ob-served during flows of less than the annual recurrence interval. These observations suggest that there are two thresholds for sediment trans-port in cascade channels. During moderate recurrence-interval flows, bedload material is rapidly and efficiently transported over the more stable bed-form-ing clasts, which have a higher mobility threshold corresponding to more in-frequent events. The lack of significant in-channel storage (Kondolf et al., 1991) and the rapid scour of depositional sites during moderately frequent high flows suggest that sediment transport is effectively supply limited in cas-cade channels. Bedload transport studies demonstrate that steep channels in mountain drainage basins are typically supply limited, receiving seasonal or stochastic sediment inputs (Nanson, 1974; Griffiths, 1980; Ashida et al., 1981; Whittaker, 1987). Because of this high transport capacity relative to sediment supply, cascade channels function primarily as sediment transport zones that rapidly deliver sediment to lower-gradient channels.},

abstract = {Channel types found in mountain drainages occupy characteristic but intergrading ranges of bed slope that reflect a dynamic balance between erosive energy and channel boundary resistance. Using a classification and regression tree (CART) modeling approach, we demonstrate that drainage area scaling of channel slopes provides better discrimination of these forms than slope alone among supply- and capacity-limited sites. Analysis of 270 stream reaches in the western United States exhibiting four common mountain channel types reveals that these types exist within relatively discrete ranges of an index of specific stream power. We also demonstrate associations among regional interannual precipitation variability, discharge distribution skewness, and means of the specific stream power index of step-pool channels. Finally, we discuss a conceptual methodology for predicting ecologically relevant morphologic units from digital elevation models at the network scale based on the finding that channel types do not exhibit equal energy dissipation.},
